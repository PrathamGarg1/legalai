, was also registered at Police Station

Notice of motion.



On asking of the Court, Mr. Vikas Bhardwaj, AAG, Haryana,
who is present in the Court, accepts notice on behalf of respondent-State.
He submits that impugned order has been passed as per law by following
all the provisions of Cr. P. C., and therefore, same is worth to sustain.
However, he is not disputing the fact that the very dispute out of which
proceedings have been initiated under 
Section 174-A
 IPC stands finalised
and the main petition under 
Section 138
 of NI Act has already been
withdrawn on 22.04.2019.



I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also

gone through the case record available before me.



It is clear that dispute between private parties regarding
cheque amount of Rs. 50,000/- has already been ended as the main
petition stands withdrawn in view of the statement of the complainant
vide order dated 22.04.2019. Learned counsel for the petitioner has
already given his explanation in para Nos. 5 and 6 of present petition

which reads as follows:



"5. That on dated 17.05.2018 the respondent No. 2

had issued a no objection certificate to the petitioner vide

CRM-M- 34291-2022 (O&M) -3-
which it is mentioned that respondent No. 2 has received
complete payment from the petitioner and there is no further
amount is outstanding towards the petitioner. It is further to
mention here that on the same day respondent No. 2 assured
that there is no need to present in person before the Court in
the proceedings of complaint
 u/s 138
 N. I. Act as you had
already deposited the entire payment and on the next date of
hearing the respondent No. 2 will withdrawn the complaint

u/s 138
 of N. I. Act. A copy of no objection certificate is

annexed herewith as Annexure P-3.



6. That on the assurance of the respondent no. 2,
the petitioner did not put his appearance before the ld. Trial

Court as he was in this impression that the respondent No. 2

would have withdraw the complaint
 u/s 138
 of N. I .Act. It is

pertinent to mention here that the petitioner was astonished
when he came to know that the respondent No. 2 has not
withdraw the complaint
 u/s 138
 of N. I. Act despite the full
payment paid by the petitioner and Id. Trial Court declared
the petitioner proclaimed offender with a direction to
register a FIR u/s 174-A against the petitioner. The copies of
order of proclaimed offender and FIR are annexed herewith

as Annexure P-4 & P-5."



A co-ordinate Bench of this Court in CRM-M-43813-2018
titled as "
Baldev Chand Bansal vs. State of Haryana and another
",
decided on 29.01.2019 has held as under:-




"Prayer in this petition is for quashing of FIR No.64

RIYA dated 15.02.2017 filed under Section 174-A of the Indian

Penal Code registered at Police Station Sector-5, Panchkula
and all other subsequent proceedings arising thereof as well
as order dated 24.10.2016 passed by the trial Court vide
which a direction was issued to register the aforesaid FIR.



XXX XXX XK

Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the
decisions rendered by this Court in " 
Vikas Sharma vs.
Gurpreet Singh Kohli and another
 (supra), 2017, (3)
L.A.R.584, Microqual Techno Limited and others Vs. State of
Haryana and another, 2015 (32) RCR (Crl.)
 
790 and
"
Rajneesh Khanna Vs. State of Haryana and another
"


2017(3) L.A.R. 555 wherein in an identical circumstance,
this Court has held that since the main petition filed under

Section 138
 of the Act stands withdrawn in view of an
amicable settlement between the parties, therefore,
continuation of proceedings under 
Section 174A
 of IPC
shall be nothing but an abuse of the process of law.



XXX XXX XK

In view of the same, I find merit in the present petition
and accordingly, present petition is allowed and the
impugned order dated 24.10.2016 passed by Judicial
Magistrate, Ist Class, Panchkula as well as FIR No.64
dated 15.02.2017 registered under 
Section 174-A
 of the
Indian Penal Code at Police Station Sector-5, Panchkula
and all other subsequent proceedings arising thereof; are
hereby quashed."

A perusal of the above judgment would show that in a
similar case where the FIR had been registered under 
Section 174-A
 IPC
in view of the order passed in proceedings under 
Section 138
 of the Act,
while declaring the petitioner therein as proclaimed offender, a co-
ordinate Bench after relying upon various judgments observed that once
the main petition under 
Section 138
 of the Act stands withdrawn in view
of an amicable settlement between the parties, the continuation of
proceedings under 
Section 174-A
 IPC is nothing but an abuse of the
process of law. The said aspect was one of the main consideration for
allowing the petition and setting aside the order declaring the petitioner
therein as proclaimed person as well as quashing of the FIR under


Section 174-A
 IPC.



Another co-ordinate Bench of this Court in a case titled as
"
Ashok Madan v. State of Haryana and another
" reported as 2020(4)

RCR (Criminal) 87 has also held as under:-




"No doubt, the learned counsel for the respondent has
vehemently argued that the offence under 
Section 174A

I.P.C. is independent of the main case, therefore, merely
because the main case has been dismissed for want of
prosecution, the present petition cannot be allowed,
however, keeping in view the fact that the present FIR was
registered only on account of absence from the proceedings
in the main case which had been subsequently regularised
by the court while granting bail to the petitioner, the default

stood condoned. In such circumstances, continuation of

CRM-M- 34291-2022 (O&M) -6-
proceedings under 
Section 174A
 I.P.C. Shall be abuse of the

process of court.



7. Accordingly, the petition is allowed. FIR No.446
dated 21.08.2017, registered under 
Section 174A
 I.P.C. At
Police Station Kotwali, District Faridabad, as well as

consequential proceedings shall stand quashed."



Relying upon the said observation, in case of 
Hitesh H.
Shah v. State of Haryana and another
 in CRM-M-12034-2022
proceedings under 
Section 174-A
 of IPC has been said to be abuse of the

process of law, once main dispute between the parties has already ended.




Under these circumstances, once the very petition stands
withdrawn on the basis of compromise, continuation of the instant FIR
under 
Section 174-A
 of IPC is nothing but an abuse of process of law. 
In
this regard reliance can be placed upon judgment rendered by this Court
in the case of 
Microqual Techno Limited and others v. State of
Haryana
 and another-2015(2) RCR (Criminal) 790 which has also
been followed in CRM-M-47891-2021 titled as 
Jitender Singh v. State

of Haryana and another
, decided on 16.11.2021.




Accordingly, the instant petition is allowed. Impugned order
dated 24.09.2018 (Annexure P-5) and the instant FIR No. 0736 dated
01.10.2018 (Annexure P-4) under 
Section 174-A
 IPC, registered at
Police Station Shivaji Nagar Disrict Gurugram, Haryana along with all

subsequent proceedings emanating therefrom, are quashed qua the

petitioner herein.
