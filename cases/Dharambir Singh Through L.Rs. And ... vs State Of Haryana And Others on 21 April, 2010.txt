M.M. KUMAR, J.



             This order shall dispose of CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of

2004 because notifications acquiring the land in both cases are the same. The

challenge in these petitions, filed under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution, is to the

notification dated 3.3.2003, issued under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) of

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         2


the 
Land Acquisition Act, 1894
 (for brevity, 'the Act') and declaration made

under 
Section 6
 of the Act, dated 4.3.2003.           Additionally, order dated

24.5.2004, passed by the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of

Haryana, Urban Estates Department, has been subject matter of challenge in

CWP No. 12905 of 2004, whereby the revision petition filed by the petitioners,

under 
Section 15-A
 of the Act, has been dismissed.



2.          Facts may first be noticed from CWP No. 9214 of 2003. The

petitioners are owners of the land measuring 10 Biswas, comprised in Khewat

No. 470/403, Khatoni No. 715, Khasra No. 2660, situated in Gurgaon, as per

jamabandi for the year 1991-92 (P-1).         It has been claimed that various

colonisers including Ansals established a colony, namely, Palam Vihar,

Gurgaon. The land belonging to the petitioners also forms part of abadi of said

Palam Vihar, which is also known as Sector 3, Gurgaon. The petitioners have

placed on record a site plan showing that their land is surrounded on two sides

by the flats made by the Ansals and in the third and fourth sides, there are sector

roads, one of which leads from Railway Road to Palam Vihar (P-2).


3.          On 3.3.2003, a notification under 
Section 4
 read with 
Section 17(1)


of the Act for acquiring the land was issued by the respondent State for a public

purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land for Haryana

Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon

under the 
Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977
 by the Haryana

Urban Development Authority, in the area of village Gurgaon, HB No. 55,

Tehsil and District Gurgaon.      Since the aforementioned land was urgently

required, therefore, the provisions of Sub-Section (1) of 
Section 17
 of the Act

were invoked and the requirement of filing of objections under 
Section 5A
 of

the Act was dispensed with (P-3). According to the petitioners the notification

was published in the official Gazette on 3.3.2003 and in terms of 
Section 4(1)
 of

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         3


the Act, the notice of the substance of the notification was caused in the locality

vie Rapat Rojnamcha No. 257, dated 5.3.2003. Besides this the aforementioned

notification was also published in the two daily newspapers, namely, 'National

Herald' (English) and 'Nav Bharat' (Hindi), dated 12.3.2003.


4.            On 4.3.2003, a declaration under 
Section 6
 read with 
Section 17(1)


of the Act was published in the official Gazette (P-4). As per provisions of


Section 6(2)
 of the Act, the declaration was published in the Haryana

Government Gazette on 4.3.2003, whereas the substance of the notification was

entered in the Rapat Rojnamcha on 5.3.2003.           The declaration was also

published in two newspapers, namely, 'National Herald' (English) and 'Nav

Bharat' (Hindi) on 12.3.2003. In this manner, the land of the petitioners has

been acquired under the said acquisition.



5.            It has further been claimed that after remaining silent for about a

month, on 3.4.2003, the Land Acquisition Collector-respondent No. 3 issued

notice under 
Section 9(1)
 of the Act requiring the petitioners to appear before

him on 21.4.2003 and to put forward their respective interests in the land and

their objections, if any, to the measurement of the lands made under 
Section 8


of the Act (P-5).



6.            The petitioners in CWP No. 12905 of 2004 are owners of the land

measuring 4 Bigas 2 Biswas, comprised in Khewat No. 806/674, Khatoni No.

1172 and 2659, situated in Gurgaon, as per jamabandi for the year 1991-92

(P-1). The factual position in this petition is same, as noticed above. The only

additional fact which is required to be noticed is that on 11.12.2003, the

petitioners filed a revision petition under 
Section 15-A
 of the Act before the

Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department,     alleging   that   no    urgency    was    involved    to    invoke

urgency/emergency provisions of 
Sections 17(1)
 and 
17(4)
 of the Act depriving

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        4


them from filing objections under 
Section 5-A
 of the Act. The arguments in the

said revision petition were heard on 14.1.2004, however, no order was passed

till the announcement of award by the Land Acquisition Collector, which was

announced on 5.3.2004. On 24.5.2004, the Commissioner and Secretary to the

Government of Haryana, Urban Estates Department dismissed the revision

petition primarily on the ground that since the award has been announced, the

merits of the case cannot be looked into. It is, however, conceded as a fact that

the possession of the land was not taken after the award and Grid Station has

already been built elsewhere.



7.          In the backdrop of the aforementioned factual position, the

petitioners have filed these petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings.

C.W.P. No. 9214 of 2003 was filed on 16.6.2003 whereas C.W.P. No. 12905 of

2004 was filed on 21.8.2004.



8.          In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2

the broad factual position has not been controverted. However, it has been

denied that there is any delay in the matter. It has been asserted that emergency

provisions were invoked because the project was of urgent nature. Regarding

revision petition filed by the petitioners (in CWP No. 12905 of 2004) it has

been submitted that the same has been decided in a reasonable time. The

respondents have also raised an objection about the maintainability of CWP No.

12905 of 2004, inasmuch as, the same has been filed on 7.8.2004 (21.8.2004?)

after announcement of award dated 5.3.2004. The respondents have also denied

that the land belonging to the petitioners falls in the abadi area of Palam Vihar.

It has also been stated that the land in question has been acquired as per the

development plan of the area, which is required for the construction of Sub-

power Grid Station for supplying the Electricity power to the residential area.

Therefore, urgency is involved.

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                          5


9.           Mr. Shailendra Jain, learned counsel for the petitioners has

vehemently argued that invocation of urgency/emergency would not ipso facto

result in dispensing with inquiry contemplated by 
Section 5-A
 of the Act.

According to the learned counsel even in cases where 
Section 17
 is invoked,

inquiry under Section 5-A is possible and in case the urgency is of such a nature

that it cannot brook delay even of 30 days then the record must speak for such a

hurry. 
In support of his submission, he has placed reliance on the judgments of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court rendered in the cases of 
Union of India v. Mukesh

Hans
, (
2004) 8 SCC 14 and Essco Fabs Private Limited v. State of Haryana
,

(2009) 2 SCC 377.




10.          
In CWP No. 12904 of 2004, Mr. Jain has further argued that before

filing the writ petition, the petitioners in this case had filed a revision petition

under 
Section 15-A
 of the Act believing the advise of the counsel on the basis

of a judgment of Gauhati High Court, rendered in the case of 
Shankar Prasad

Banik v. Collector, Karimganj
, AIR 1994 Gauhati 56.                 However, the

Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department, non-suited the petitioners on the ground that award had already

been announced. According to the learned counsel, revision petition was filed

before the award and the arguments were heard on 14.1.2004 and the order was

passed on 24.5.2004. He has maintained that there is a valid and rationale

explanation for coming to the Court after the award, especially when the

notifications under 
Sections 4
 and 
6
 had already been challenged before the

competent authority by filing a revision petition under 
Section 15-A
 of the Act.

Mr. Jain has also pointed out that land was sought to be acquired for setting up

a Gird Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon, has already been set up on another area.


11.          Mr. Kamal Sehgal, learned State counsel has argued that in cases of

urgency, there is no specific requirement of recording reasons for dispensing

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         6


with inquiry contemplated by 
Section 5-A
 of the Act. He has maintained that

once 
Section 17
 of the Act has been invoked then urgency is presumed to exist

and the procedural detail in finalising the acquisition proceedings would not

adversely affect legally invoked urgency provisions of 
Section 17
 of the Act.

Mr. Sehgal has produced the record as per the directions issued by this Court

and has stated that the stay order passed by this Court have been given effect

and the possession of the land has not been taken. In that regard, he has placed

on record the correspondence of 2008, which are Mark 'A' and 'B'. A perusal

of the aforesaid correspondence shows that the possession of the land was not

taken on account of the stay granted in both these petitions.


12.         After hearing learned counsel for the parties, perusing their

pleadings and the record, we are of the view that these petitions deserves to be

allowed. A perusal of the record shows that there is no application of mind

highlighting that the urgency of establishing the Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at

Gurgaon, was of such a nature that the land was required immediately and there

was no time to hold an inquiry under 
Section 5-A
 of the Act.             The only

indication in the record is that the land is being acquired by invoking 
Section 17


of the Act, which is no compliance with the requirement of law. It is trite to

mention that law concerning compulsory acquisition of land has to be

considered strictly as it is an expropriatory legislation. In that regard, reliance

may be placed on the judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the cases of

Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2008) 1 SCC 728 and Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Darius Shapur Chenal, (2005) 7 SCC


627. It follows that the provisions of 
Section 17
 of the Act have to be examined

in the light of the aforesaid principle of construction 
laid down by
 Hon'ble the

Supreme Court. 
Section 17(4)
 of the Act reads thus:-



            "17(4).      In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        7


            appropriate Government, the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-

            section (2) are applicable, the appropriate government may direct

            that the provisions of Section 5-A shall not apply, and if it does do

            direct, a declaration may be made under 
Section 6
 in respect of the

            land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification

            under 
Section 4
 sub-section (1)."



13.         The aforesaid provision clearly spells out that the appropriate

Government is under an obligation to take an express and a conscious decision

that provisions of Section 5-A are not to apply and it is thereafter that

declaration under 
Section 6
 could be issued at any time after the publication of

the notification under 
Section 4(1)
 of the Act. The aforesaid provision came up

interpretation of their Lordships of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of


Mukesh Hans
 (supra).        The principle enunciated by their Lordships' is

discernible from para 32 of the judgment, which reads thus:-


            "32. A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to

            the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows

            mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a

            condition precedent for invoking 
Section 17(4)
 that by itself is not

            sufficient to direct the dispensation of 5A inquiry. It requires an

            opinion to be formed by the concerned government that along with

            the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is

            also a need for dispensing with 5A inquiry which indicates that the

            Legislature intended that the appropriate government to apply its

            mind before dispensing with 5A inquiry. It also indicates the mere

            existence of an urgency under 
Section 17(1)
 or unforeseen

            emergency under 
Section 17(2)
 would not by themselves be

            sufficient for dispensing with 5A inquiry. If that was not the

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         8


            intention of the Legislature then the latter part of sub-section (4) of

            
Section 17
 would not have been necessary and the Legislature in

            
Section 17(1)
 and (2) itself could have incorporated that in such

            situation of existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency

            automatically 5A inquiry will be dispensed with. But then that is

            not language of the Section which in our opinion requires the

            appropriate Government to further consider the need for dispensing

            with 5A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency.

            This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application

            of mind by the appropriate Government while dispensing with 5A

            inquiry does not mean that in and every case when there is an

            urgency contemplated under 
Section 17(1)
 and unforeseen

            emergency contemplated under 
Section 17(2)
 exists that by itself

            would not contain the need for dispensing with 5A inquiry. It is

            possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate

            Government under 
Section 17(1)
 or the unforeseen emergency

            under 
Section 17(2)
 itself may be of such degree that it could

            require the appropriate Government on that very basis to dispense

            with the inquiry under Section 5A but then there is a need for

            application for mind by the appropriate Government that such an

            urgency for dispensation of the 5A inquiry is inherent in the two

            types of urgencies contemplated under 
Section 17(1)
 and (2) of the

            Act." (emphasis added)


14.         A perusal of the aforesaid para shows that an opinion is required to

be formed by the State Government that along with the existence of urgency or

unforeseen emergency contemplated by 
Section 17(1)
 and 
Section 17(2)


respectively, there is also a need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. The

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        9


aforesaid provision indicates that the Legislature intended the appropriate

Government to apply its mind before dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

has further been pointed out that mere existence or unforeseen emergency

would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

means, even in cases of urgency or emergency right to file objections and grant

of an opportunity to hearing under 
Section 5A
 of the Act may still be kept

intact. The decision of 
Mukesh Hans
's case (supra) has been followed and

applied in the case of 
Essco Fab
 (supra).
 Furthermore, this Court while

deciding the cases of Punita Chaudhary and others v. State of Haryana

(CWP No. 3129 of 2008, decided on 8.12.2008) and Bhopu and others v.

State of Haryana and others (CWP No. 16832 of 2003, decided on

18.1.2010), has also followed the aforesaid decision.


15.         When the aforesaid principles are applied to the facts of present

case, it becomes evident from the perusal of the original record that there is no

decision with regard to dispensing with inquiry under 
Section 5-A
 of the Act.

An office note dated 23.1.2003, would show that a proposal for acquisition of

2.89 acres of land for the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid

Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon under emergency clause was put up. The

matter was processed through the Financial Commissioner Town and Country

Planning. The note when translated into English reads thus:


            "From pre page:



                  This matter pertains to the acquisition of 2.89 acres of land in

            Sector 2 and 3 Gurgaon, for Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam under

          to be acquired, from the District Town Planner, Gurgaon, has

16.         A perusal of the noting shows that there is no whisper with regard

to dispensing with inquiry under 
Section 5-A
 of the Act what to talk of taking

any decision for dispensing with such an inquiry showing that there is complete

lack of application of mind as required by the principle laid down in 
Mukesh

Hans
's case (supra). In the absence of any such decision dispensing with

Section 5-A enquiry, 
Section 17(4)
 of the Act could not alone be invoked to

defeat the vital rights of hearing and filing objections by the land owners.


17.         The argument of the learned State counsel that C.W.P. No. 12905

of 2004 has been filed after the award is not sustainable in the peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case because the petitioners had earlier filed a revision

petition under 
Section 15-A
 of the Act before the Commissioner and Secretary

to Government Haryana, Urban Estates Department, on 10.12.2003. Moreover,

the arguments were heard by the Commissioner and Secretary on 14.1.2004 and

the order was not passed deliberately so as to enable the respondent State to

announce the award. It is also pertinent to notice that possession of the land has

not been taken. Eventually, on 24.5.2004 the Commissioner dismissed the

revision petition holding that award has already been announced and nothing

could be done thereafter. Apart from the fact that filing of the revision petition

would furnish reasonable explanation for coming to this Court after passing of

award, the petitioners cannot be faulted for not challenging the acquisition

proceedings before passing of the award. The revision petition was filed before

passing of award challenging acquisition proceedings which were based on a

 CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                       13


judgment of the Gauhati High Court in the case of 
Shankar Prasad Banik


(supra). Moreover, the land cannot be considered to have vested in the State

free from all encumbrances because possession was not taken and 
Section 48
 of

the Act has not exhausted itself. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of

this case we cannot sustain the objection with regard to filing of this petition

after the award.     The present case is an exception to the general rule.

Accordingly, the objection is rejected.




18.         There is yet another factor which lead us to lean in favour of the

petitioners. The land was acquired for setting up of a Grid Station in Sector 2-3

at Gurgaon. As per the un-controverted stand taken by the petitioners, the Grid

Station has already been established elsewhere. Therefore, the land may not

even otherwise be required for the notified public purpose. This may not itself

be sufficient to quash the impugned acquisition notifications but coupled with

other factors, this factor would assume significance.


19.         As a sequel to the above discussion, both the petitions succeed and

the impugned notification under 
Section 4
 of the Act, dated 3.3.2003,

declaration under 
Section 6
 of the Act, dated 4.3.2003, order dated 24.5.2004

passed by the Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban

Estates Department (in CWP No. 12905 of 2004) or any other proceedings

pursuance to such declaration are hereby quashed qua the petitioners. The

respondent State, however, is not debarred from acquiring the land in question

in accordance with law.

case.

Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_1, Content: This order shall dispose of CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of

2004 because notifications acquiring the land in both cases are the same. The

challenge in these petitions, filed underArticle 226of the Constitution, is to the

notification dated 3.3.2003, issued under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) ofCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         2theLand Acquisition Act, 1894(for brevity, 'the Act') and declaration made

underSection 6of the Act, dated 4.3.2003.           Additionally, order dated

24.5.2004, passed by the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of

Haryana, Urban Estates Department, has been subject matter of challenge in

CWP No. 12905 of 2004, whereby the revision petition filed by the petitioners,

underSection 15-Aof the Act, has been dismissed.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_2, Content: 2.          Facts may first be noticed from CWP No. 9214 of 2003. The

petitioners are owners of the land measuring 10 Biswas, comprised in Khewat

No. 470/403, Khatoni No. 715, Khasra No. 2660, situated in Gurgaon, as per

jamabandi for the year 1991-92 (P-1).         It has been claimed that various

colonisers including Ansals established a colony, namely, Palam Vihar,

Gurgaon. The land belonging to the petitioners also forms part of abadi of said

Palam Vihar, which is also known as Sector 3, Gurgaon. The petitioners have

placed on record a site plan showing that their land is surrounded on two sides

by the flats made by the Ansals and in the third and fourth sides, there are sector

roads, one of which leads from Railway Road to Palam Vihar (P-2).
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_3, Content: 3.          On 3.3.2003, a notification underSection 4read withSection 17(1)of the Act for acquiring the land was issued by the respondent State for a public

purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land for Haryana

Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon

under theHaryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977by the Haryana

Urban Development Authority, in the area of village Gurgaon, HB No. 55,

Tehsil and District Gurgaon.      Since the aforementioned land was urgently

required, therefore, the provisions of Sub-Section (1) ofSection 17of the Act

were invoked and the requirement of filing of objections underSection 5Aof

the Act was dispensed with (P-3). According to the petitioners the notification

was published in the official Gazette on 3.3.2003 and in terms ofSection 4(1)ofCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         3the Act, the notice of the substance of the notification was caused in the locality

vie Rapat Rojnamcha No. 257, dated 5.3.2003. Besides this the aforementioned

notification was also published in the two daily newspapers, namely, 'National

Herald' (English) and 'Nav Bharat' (Hindi), dated 12.3.2003.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_4, Content: 4.            On 4.3.2003, a declaration underSection 6read withSection 17(1)of the Act was published in the official Gazette (P-4). As per provisions ofSection 6(2)of the Act, the declaration was published in the Haryana

Government Gazette on 4.3.2003, whereas the substance of the notification was

entered in the Rapat Rojnamcha on 5.3.2003.           The declaration was also

published in two newspapers, namely, 'National Herald' (English) and 'Nav

Bharat' (Hindi) on 12.3.2003. In this manner, the land of the petitioners has

been acquired under the said acquisition.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_5, Content: 5.            It has further been claimed that after remaining silent for about a

month, on 3.4.2003, the Land Acquisition Collector-respondent No. 3 issued

notice underSection 9(1)of the Act requiring the petitioners to appear before

him on 21.4.2003 and to put forward their respective interests in the land and

their objections, if any, to the measurement of the lands made underSection 8of the Act (P-5).
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_6, Content: 6.            The petitioners in CWP No. 12905 of 2004 are owners of the land

measuring 4 Bigas 2 Biswas, comprised in Khewat No. 806/674, Khatoni No.

1172 and 2659, situated in Gurgaon, as per jamabandi for the year 1991-92

(P-1). The factual position in this petition is same, as noticed above. The only

additional fact which is required to be noticed is that on 11.12.2003, the

petitioners filed a revision petition underSection 15-Aof the Act before the

Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department,     alleging   that   no    urgency    was    involved    to    invoke

urgency/emergency provisions ofSections 17(1)and17(4)of the Act deprivingCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        4them from filing objections underSection 5-Aof the Act. The arguments in the

said revision petition were heard on 14.1.2004, however, no order was passed

till the announcement of award by the Land Acquisition Collector, which was

announced on 5.3.2004. On 24.5.2004, the Commissioner and Secretary to the

Government of Haryana, Urban Estates Department dismissed the revision

petition primarily on the ground that since the award has been announced, the

merits of the case cannot be looked into. It is, however, conceded as a fact that

the possession of the land was not taken after the award and Grid Station has

already been built elsewhere.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_7, Content: 7.          In the backdrop of the aforementioned factual position, the

petitioners have filed these petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings.

C.W.P. No. 9214 of 2003 was filed on 16.6.2003 whereas C.W.P. No. 12905 of

2004 was filed on 21.8.2004.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_8, Content: 8.          In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2

the broad factual position has not been controverted. However, it has been

denied that there is any delay in the matter. It has been asserted that emergency

provisions were invoked because the project was of urgent nature. Regarding

revision petition filed by the petitioners (in CWP No. 12905 of 2004) it has

been submitted that the same has been decided in a reasonable time. The

respondents have also raised an objection about the maintainability of CWP No.

12905 of 2004, inasmuch as, the same has been filed on 7.8.2004 (21.8.2004?)

after announcement of award dated 5.3.2004. The respondents have also denied

that the land belonging to the petitioners falls in the abadi area of Palam Vihar.

It has also been stated that the land in question has been acquired as per the

development plan of the area, which is required for the construction of Sub-

power Grid Station for supplying the Electricity power to the residential area.

Therefore, urgency is involved.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_9, Content: 
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_10, Content: 9.           Mr. Shailendra Jain, learned counsel for the petitioners has

vehemently argued that invocation of urgency/emergency would not ipso facto

result in dispensing with inquiry contemplated bySection 5-Aof the Act.

According to the learned counsel even in cases whereSection 17is invoked,

inquiry under Section 5-A is possible and in case the urgency is of such a nature

that it cannot brook delay even of 30 days then the record must speak for such a

hurry.In support of his submission, he has placed reliance on the judgments of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court rendered in the cases ofUnion of India v. Mukesh

Hans, (2004) 8 SCC 14 and Essco Fabs Private Limited v. State of Haryana,

(2009) 2 SCC 377.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_11, Content: 10.In CWP No. 12904 of 2004, Mr. Jain has further argued that before

filing the writ petition, the petitioners in this case had filed a revision petition

underSection 15-Aof the Act believing the advise of the counsel on the basis

of a judgment of Gauhati High Court, rendered in the case ofShankar Prasad

Banik v. Collector, Karimganj, AIR 1994 Gauhati 56.                 However, the

Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department, non-suited the petitioners on the ground that award had already

been announced. According to the learned counsel, revision petition was filed

before the award and the arguments were heard on 14.1.2004 and the order was

passed on 24.5.2004. He has maintained that there is a valid and rationale

explanation for coming to the Court after the award, especially when the

notifications underSections 4and6had already been challenged before the

competent authority by filing a revision petition underSection 15-Aof the Act.

Mr. Jain has also pointed out that land was sought to be acquired for setting up

a Gird Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon, has already been set up on another area.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_12, Content: 11.          Mr. Kamal Sehgal, learned State counsel has argued that in cases of

urgency, there is no specific requirement of recording reasons for dispensingCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         6with inquiry contemplated bySection 5-Aof the Act. He has maintained that

onceSection 17of the Act has been invoked then urgency is presumed to exist

and the procedural detail in finalising the acquisition proceedings would not

adversely affect legally invoked urgency provisions ofSection 17of the Act.

Mr. Sehgal has produced the record as per the directions issued by this Court

and has stated that the stay order passed by this Court have been given effect

and the possession of the land has not been taken. In that regard, he has placed

on record the correspondence of 2008, which are Mark 'A' and 'B'. A perusal

of the aforesaid correspondence shows that the possession of the land was not

taken on account of the stay granted in both these petitions.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_13, Content: 12.         After hearing learned counsel for the parties, perusing their

pleadings and the record, we are of the view that these petitions deserves to be

allowed. A perusal of the record shows that there is no application of mind

highlighting that the urgency of establishing the Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at

Gurgaon, was of such a nature that the land was required immediately and there

was no time to hold an inquiry underSection 5-Aof the Act.             The only

indication in the record is that the land is being acquired by invokingSection 17of the Act, which is no compliance with the requirement of law. It is trite to

mention that law concerning compulsory acquisition of land has to be

considered strictly as it is an expropriatory legislation. In that regard, reliance

may be placed on the judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the cases of

Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2008) 1 SCC 728 and Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Darius Shapur Chenal, (2005) 7 SCC
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_14, Content: 627. It follows that the provisions ofSection 17of the Act have to be examined

in the light of the aforesaid principle of constructionlaid down byHon'ble the

Supreme Court.Section 17(4)of the Act reads thus:-
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_15, Content: 13.         The aforesaid provision clearly spells out that the appropriate

Government is under an obligation to take an express and a conscious decision

that provisions of Section 5-A are not to apply and it is thereafter that

declaration underSection 6could be issued at any time after the publication of

the notification underSection 4(1)of the Act. The aforesaid provision came up

interpretation of their Lordships of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case ofMukesh Hans(supra).        The principle enunciated by their Lordships' is

discernible from para 32 of the judgment, which reads thus:-
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_16, Content: 14.         A perusal of the aforesaid para shows that an opinion is required to

be formed by the State Government that along with the existence of urgency or

unforeseen emergency contemplated bySection 17(1)andSection 17(2)respectively, there is also a need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. TheCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        9aforesaid provision indicates that the Legislature intended the appropriate

Government to apply its mind before dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

has further been pointed out that mere existence or unforeseen emergency

would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

means, even in cases of urgency or emergency right to file objections and grant

of an opportunity to hearing underSection 5Aof the Act may still be kept

intact. The decision ofMukesh Hans's case (supra) has been followed and

applied in the case ofEssco Fab(supra).Furthermore, this Court while

deciding the cases of Punita Chaudhary and others v. State of Haryana

(CWP No. 3129 of 2008, decided on 8.12.2008) and Bhopu and others v.

State of Haryana and others (CWP No. 16832 of 2003, decided on

18.1.2010), has also followed the aforesaid decision.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_17, Content: 15.         When the aforesaid principles are applied to the facts of present

case, it becomes evident from the perusal of the original record that there is no

decision with regard to dispensing with inquiry underSection 5-Aof the Act.

An office note dated 23.1.2003, would show that a proposal for acquisition of

2.89 acres of land for the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid

Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon under emergency clause was put up. The

M.M. KUMAR, J.This order shall dispose of CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of

2004 because notifications acquiring the land in both cases are the same. The

challenge in these petitions, filed underArticle 226of the Constitution, is to the

notification dated 3.3.2003, issued under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) ofCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         2theLand Acquisition Act, 1894(for brevity, 'the Act') and declaration made

underSection 6of the Act, dated 4.3.2003.           Additionally, order dated

24.5.2004, passed by the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of

Haryana, Urban Estates Department, has been subject matter of challenge in

CWP No. 12905 of 2004, whereby the revision petition filed by the petitioners,

underSection 15-Aof the Act, has been dismissed.2.          Facts may first be noticed from CWP No. 9214 of 2003. The

petitioners are owners of the land measuring 10 Biswas, comprised in Khewat

No. 470/403, Khatoni No. 715, Khasra No. 2660, situated in Gurgaon, as per

jamabandi for the year 1991-92 (P-1).         It has been claimed that various

colonisers including Ansals established a colony, namely, Palam Vihar,

Gurgaon. The land belonging to the petitioners also forms part of abadi of said

Palam Vihar, which is also known as Sector 3, Gurgaon. The petitioners have

placed on record a site plan showing that their land is surrounded on two sides

by the flats made by the Ansals and in the third and fourth sides, there are sector

roads, one of which leads from Railway Road to Palam Vihar (P-2).3.          On 3.3.2003, a notification underSection 4read withSection 17(1)of the Act for acquiring the land was issued by the respondent State for a public

purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land for Haryana

Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon

under theHaryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977by the Haryana

Urban Development Authority, in the area of village Gurgaon, HB No. 55,

Tehsil and District Gurgaon.      Since the aforementioned land was urgently

required, therefore, the provisions of Sub-Section (1) ofSection 17of the Act

were invoked and the requirement of filing of objections underSection 5Aof

the Act was dispensed with (P-3). According to the petitioners the notification

was published in the official Gazette on 3.3.2003 and in terms ofSection 4(1)ofCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         3the Act, the notice of the substance of the notification was caused in the locality

vie Rapat Rojnamcha No. 257, dated 5.3.2003. Besides this the aforementioned

notification was also published in the two daily newspapers, namely, 'National

Herald' (English) and 'Nav Bharat' (Hindi), dated 12.3.2003.4.            On 4.3.2003, a declaration underSection 6read withSection 17(1)of the Act was published in the official Gazette (P-4). As per provisions ofSection 6(2)of the Act, the declaration was published in the Haryana

Government Gazette on 4.3.2003, whereas the substance of the notification was

entered in the Rapat Rojnamcha on 5.3.2003.           The declaration was also

published in two newspapers, namely, 'National Herald' (English) and 'Nav

Bharat' (Hindi) on 12.3.2003. In this manner, the land of the petitioners has

been acquired under the said acquisition.5.            It has further been claimed that after remaining silent for about a

month, on 3.4.2003, the Land Acquisition Collector-respondent No. 3 issued

notice underSection 9(1)of the Act requiring the petitioners to appear before

him on 21.4.2003 and to put forward their respective interests in the land and

their objections, if any, to the measurement of the lands made underSection 8of the Act (P-5).6.            The petitioners in CWP No. 12905 of 2004 are owners of the land

measuring 4 Bigas 2 Biswas, comprised in Khewat No. 806/674, Khatoni No.

1172 and 2659, situated in Gurgaon, as per jamabandi for the year 1991-92

(P-1). The factual position in this petition is same, as noticed above. The only

additional fact which is required to be noticed is that on 11.12.2003, the

petitioners filed a revision petition underSection 15-Aof the Act before the

Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department,     alleging   that   no    urgency    was    involved    to    invoke

urgency/emergency provisions ofSections 17(1)and17(4)of the Act deprivingCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        4them from filing objections underSection 5-Aof the Act. The arguments in the

said revision petition were heard on 14.1.2004, however, no order was passed

till the announcement of award by the Land Acquisition Collector, which was

announced on 5.3.2004. On 24.5.2004, the Commissioner and Secretary to the

Government of Haryana, Urban Estates Department dismissed the revision

petition primarily on the ground that since the award has been announced, the

merits of the case cannot be looked into. It is, however, conceded as a fact that

the possession of the land was not taken after the award and Grid Station has

already been built elsewhere.7.          In the backdrop of the aforementioned factual position, the

petitioners have filed these petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings.

C.W.P. No. 9214 of 2003 was filed on 16.6.2003 whereas C.W.P. No. 12905 of

2004 was filed on 21.8.2004.8.          In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2

the broad factual position has not been controverted. However, it has been

denied that there is any delay in the matter. It has been asserted that emergency

provisions were invoked because the project was of urgent nature. Regarding

revision petition filed by the petitioners (in CWP No. 12905 of 2004) it has

been submitted that the same has been decided in a reasonable time. The

respondents have also raised an objection about the maintainability of CWP No.

12905 of 2004, inasmuch as, the same has been filed on 7.8.2004 (21.8.2004?)

after announcement of award dated 5.3.2004. The respondents have also denied

that the land belonging to the petitioners falls in the abadi area of Palam Vihar.

It has also been stated that the land in question has been acquired as per the

development plan of the area, which is required for the construction of Sub-

power Grid Station for supplying the Electricity power to the residential area.

Therefore, urgency is involved.CWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                          59.           Mr. Shailendra Jain, learned counsel for the petitioners has

vehemently argued that invocation of urgency/emergency would not ipso facto

result in dispensing with inquiry contemplated bySection 5-Aof the Act.

According to the learned counsel even in cases whereSection 17is invoked,

inquiry under Section 5-A is possible and in case the urgency is of such a nature

that it cannot brook delay even of 30 days then the record must speak for such a

hurry.In support of his submission, he has placed reliance on the judgments of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court rendered in the cases ofUnion of India v. Mukesh

Hans, (2004) 8 SCC 14 and Essco Fabs Private Limited v. State of Haryana,

(2009) 2 SCC 377.10.In CWP No. 12904 of 2004, Mr. Jain has further argued that before

filing the writ petition, the petitioners in this case had filed a revision petition

underSection 15-Aof the Act believing the advise of the counsel on the basis

of a judgment of Gauhati High Court, rendered in the case ofShankar Prasad

Banik v. Collector, Karimganj, AIR 1994 Gauhati 56.                 However, the

Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department, non-suited the petitioners on the ground that award had already

been announced. According to the learned counsel, revision petition was filed

before the award and the arguments were heard on 14.1.2004 and the order was

passed on 24.5.2004. He has maintained that there is a valid and rationale

explanation for coming to the Court after the award, especially when the

notifications underSections 4and6had already been challenged before the

competent authority by filing a revision petition underSection 15-Aof the Act.

Mr. Jain has also pointed out that land was sought to be acquired for setting up

a Gird Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon, has already been set up on another area.11.          Mr. Kamal Sehgal, learned State counsel has argued that in cases of

urgency, there is no specific requirement of recording reasons for dispensingCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         6with inquiry contemplated bySection 5-Aof the Act. He has maintained that

onceSection 17of the Act has been invoked then urgency is presumed to exist

and the procedural detail in finalising the acquisition proceedings would not

adversely affect legally invoked urgency provisions ofSection 17of the Act.

Mr. Sehgal has produced the record as per the directions issued by this Court

and has stated that the stay order passed by this Court have been given effect

and the possession of the land has not been taken. In that regard, he has placed

on record the correspondence of 2008, which are Mark 'A' and 'B'. A perusal

of the aforesaid correspondence shows that the possession of the land was not

taken on account of the stay granted in both these petitions.12.         After hearing learned counsel for the parties, perusing their

pleadings and the record, we are of the view that these petitions deserves to be

allowed. A perusal of the record shows that there is no application of mind

highlighting that the urgency of establishing the Grid Station in Sector 2-3 at

Gurgaon, was of such a nature that the land was required immediately and there

was no time to hold an inquiry underSection 5-Aof the Act.             The only

indication in the record is that the land is being acquired by invokingSection 17of the Act, which is no compliance with the requirement of law. It is trite to

mention that law concerning compulsory acquisition of land has to be

considered strictly as it is an expropriatory legislation. In that regard, reliance

may be placed on the judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the cases of

Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2008) 1 SCC 728 and Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Darius Shapur Chenal, (2005) 7 SCC627. It follows that the provisions ofSection 17of the Act have to be examined

in the light of the aforesaid principle of constructionlaid down byHon'ble the

Supreme Court.Section 17(4)of the Act reads thus:-"17(4).      In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of theCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        7appropriate Government, the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-

            section (2) are applicable, the appropriate government may direct

            that the provisions of Section 5-A shall not apply, and if it does do

            direct, a declaration may be made underSection 6in respect of the

            land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification

            underSection 4sub-section (1)."13.         The aforesaid provision clearly spells out that the appropriate

Government is under an obligation to take an express and a conscious decision

that provisions of Section 5-A are not to apply and it is thereafter that

declaration underSection 6could be issued at any time after the publication of

the notification underSection 4(1)of the Act. The aforesaid provision came up

interpretation of their Lordships of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case ofMukesh Hans(supra).        The principle enunciated by their Lordships' is

discernible from para 32 of the judgment, which reads thus:-"32. A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to

            the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows

            mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a

            condition precedent for invokingSection 17(4)that by itself is not

            sufficient to direct the dispensation of 5A inquiry. It requires an

            opinion to be formed by the concerned government that along with

            the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is

            also a need for dispensing with 5A inquiry which indicates that the

            Legislature intended that the appropriate government to apply its

            mind before dispensing with 5A inquiry. It also indicates the mere

            existence of an urgency underSection 17(1)or unforeseen

            emergency underSection 17(2)would not by themselves be

            sufficient for dispensing with 5A inquiry. If that was not theCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                         8intention of the Legislature then the latter part of sub-section (4) ofSection 17would not have been necessary and the Legislature inSection 17(1)and (2) itself could have incorporated that in such

            situation of existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency

            automatically 5A inquiry will be dispensed with. But then that is

            not language of the Section which in our opinion requires the

            appropriate Government to further consider the need for dispensing

            with 5A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency.

            This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application

            of mind by the appropriate Government while dispensing with 5A

            inquiry does not mean that in and every case when there is an

            urgency contemplated underSection 17(1)and unforeseen

            emergency contemplated underSection 17(2)exists that by itself

            would not contain the need for dispensing with 5A inquiry. It is

            possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate

            Government underSection 17(1)or the unforeseen emergency

            underSection 17(2)itself may be of such degree that it could

            require the appropriate Government on that very basis to dispense

            with the inquiry under Section 5A but then there is a need for

            application for mind by the appropriate Government that such an

            urgency for dispensation of the 5A inquiry is inherent in the two

            types of urgencies contemplated underSection 17(1)and (2) of the

            Act." (emphasis added)14.         A perusal of the aforesaid para shows that an opinion is required to

be formed by the State Government that along with the existence of urgency or

unforeseen emergency contemplated bySection 17(1)andSection 17(2)respectively, there is also a need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. TheCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        9aforesaid provision indicates that the Legislature intended the appropriate

Government to apply its mind before dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

has further been pointed out that mere existence or unforeseen emergency

would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

means, even in cases of urgency or emergency right to file objections and grant

of an opportunity to hearing underSection 5Aof the Act may still be kept

intact. The decision ofMukesh Hans's case (supra) has been followed and

applied in the case ofEssco Fab(supra).Furthermore, this Court while

deciding the cases of Punita Chaudhary and others v. State of Haryana

(CWP No. 3129 of 2008, decided on 8.12.2008) and Bhopu and others v.

State of Haryana and others (CWP No. 16832 of 2003, decided on

18.1.2010), has also followed the aforesaid decision.15.         When the aforesaid principles are applied to the facts of present

case, it becomes evident from the perusal of the original record that there is no

decision with regard to dispensing with inquiry underSection 5-Aof the Act.

An office note dated 23.1.2003, would show that a proposal for acquisition of

2.89 acres of land for the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam for setting up Grid

Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon under emergency clause was put up. The

matter was processed through the Financial Commissioner Town and Country

Planning. The note when translated into English reads thus:"From pre page:This matter pertains to the acquisition of 2.89 acres of land in

to dispensing with inquiry underSection 5-Aof the Act what to talk of taking

any decision for dispensing with such an inquiry showing that there is complete

lack of application of mind as required by the principle laid down inMukesh

Hans's case (supra). In the absence of any such decision dispensing with

Section 5-A enquiry,Section 17(4)of the Act could not alone be invoked to

defeat the vital rights of hearing and filing objections by the land owners.17.         The argument of the learned State counsel that C.W.P. No. 12905

of 2004 has been filed after the award is not sustainable in the peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case because the petitioners had earlier filed a revision

petition underSection 15-Aof the Act before the Commissioner and Secretary

to Government Haryana, Urban Estates Department, on 10.12.2003. Moreover,

the arguments were heard by the Commissioner and Secretary on 14.1.2004 and

the order was not passed deliberately so as to enable the respondent State to

announce the award. It is also pertinent to notice that possession of the land has

not been taken. Eventually, on 24.5.2004 the Commissioner dismissed the

revision petition holding that award has already been announced and nothing

could be done thereafter. Apart from the fact that filing of the revision petition

would furnish reasonable explanation for coming to this Court after passing of

award, the petitioners cannot be faulted for not challenging the acquisition

proceedings before passing of the award. The revision petition was filed before

passing of award challenging acquisition proceedings which were based on aCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                       13judgment of the Gauhati High Court in the case ofShankar Prasad Banik(supra). Moreover, the land cannot be considered to have vested in the State

free from all encumbrances because possession was not taken andSection 48of

the Act has not exhausted itself. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of

this case we cannot sustain the objection with regard to filing of this petition

after the award.     The present case is an exception to the general rule.

Accordingly, the objection is rejected.18.         There is yet another factor which lead us to lean in favour of the

petitioners. The land was acquired for setting up of a Grid Station in Sector 2-3

at Gurgaon. As per the un-controverted stand taken by the petitioners, the Grid

Station has already been established elsewhere. Therefore, the land may not

even otherwise be required for the notified public purpose. This may not itself

be sufficient to quash the impugned acquisition notifications but coupled with

other factors, this factor would assume significance.19.         As a sequel to the above discussion, both the petitions succeed and

the impugned notification underSection 4of the Act, dated 3.3.2003,

declaration underSection 6of the Act, dated 4.3.2003, order dated 24.5.2004

passed by the Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban

Estates Department (in CWP No. 12905 of 2004) or any other proceedings

pursuance to such declaration are hereby quashed qua the petitioners. The

respondent State, however, is not debarred from acquiring the land in question

in accordance with law.A photocopy of this order be placed on the file of the connected

case.(M.M. KUMAR)

Tag: span, Class: citetext, ID: span_7, Content: In CWP No. 12904 of 2004, Mr. Jain has further argued that before

filing the writ petition, the petitioners in this case had filed a revision petition

underSection 15-Aof the Act believing the advise of the counsel on the basis

of a judgment of Gauhati High Court, rendered in the case ofShankar Prasad

Banik v. Collector, Karimganj, AIR 1994 Gauhati 56.                 However, the

Commissioner and Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Estates

Department, non-suited the petitioners on the ground that award had already

been announced. According to the learned counsel, revision petition was filed

before the award and the arguments were heard on 14.1.2004 and the order was

passed on 24.5.2004. He has maintained that there is a valid and rationale

explanation for coming to the Court after the award, especially when the

notifications underSections 4and6had already been challenged before the

competent authority by filing a revision petition underSection 15-Aof the Act.

Mr. Jain has also pointed out that land was sought to be acquired for setting up

a Gird Station in Sector 2-3 at Gurgaon, has already been set up on another area.

Government is under an obligation to take an express and a conscious decision

that provisions of Section 5-A are not to apply and it is thereafter that

declaration underSection 6could be issued at any time after the publication of

the notification underSection 4(1)of the Act. The aforesaid provision came up

interpretation of their Lordships of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case ofMukesh Hans(supra).        The principle enunciated by their Lordships' is

discernible from para 32 of the judgment, which reads thus:-

be formed by the State Government that along with the existence of urgency or

unforeseen emergency contemplated bySection 17(1)andSection 17(2)respectively, there is also a need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. TheCWP Nos. 9214 of 2003 & 12905 of 2004                                        9aforesaid provision indicates that the Legislature intended the appropriate

Government to apply its mind before dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

has further been pointed out that mere existence or unforeseen emergency

would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It

means, even in cases of urgency or emergency right to file objections and grant

of an opportunity to hearing underSection 5Aof the Act may still be kept

intact. The decision ofMukesh Hans's case (supra) has been followed and

applied in the case ofEssco Fab(supra).
