                               prosecution could be elicited from his mouth.

                               PW-2 Raj Kumar: He was also witness from             the public

                               and failed to support the prosecution case. Even from

                               his    cross-examination,      nothing    favourable      to    the

                               to depose in favour of the prosecution. From his cross-

                               examination also, the Public Prosecutor, could not bring

                               out anything in favour of the prosecution.

                               PW-4 Hans Raj @ Hansu: He too was a private person

                               and failed to support the prosecution case. Even from

                               his    lengthy   cross-examination,       the   learned    Public

                               Prosecutor could not improve the prosecution case.

                               PW-5 Sandeep:        He was also a private person and the

                               position remained the same.        He too failed to support

                               the case of the prosecution and in spite of the cross-

                               examination      running    into   two    pages,   the     Public

                               Prosecutor failed in his attempt to elicit anything in

                               favour of the prosecution.



                               PW-6 Raghbir Singh, retired Sub Inspector of the Police:

                                 the investigation at Fatehabad on 07.12.2006.          The

                                 witness disclosed to the Sub Inspector that he had gone

                                 to Madhuban from District Rewari to attend VIP Security

                               voice of Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh. The witness further

                               deposed that Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh pressurized

                               accused Raj Kumar to ask the witness to pay ` 30,000/-. It

                               was further deposed that there was yet another Raj

                               Kumar, who was left by Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh

                               while his brother Raj Kumar was implicated.


                  22.          After completion of the evidence of both the sides,

                  arguments were heard and the learned trial court held the four

                  appellants guilty and awarded the sentences as has been discussed

                  in the earlier part of this judgement.



                  23.          Mr. Sidakamat Sidhu, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Pardeep Kumar argued that there was non-compliance of

                  
Section 42
 of the NDPS Act since receipt of the secret information

                  was not reduced into writing and no information regarding the

                  same was sent to the senior police officers. He further argued that

                  no independent witness was joined to witness the recovery.

                  Therefore, the whole case propounded by the prosecution qua

                  appellant Pardeep Kumar was doubtful and benefit of the same

                  should be extended to him.



                  24.          Shri Sudhir Sharma, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Raj Kumar submitted that the identity of appellant Raj

                  Kumar has not been established in the present case since the name

                  mentioned in the FIR was of Raj Kumar Jat resident of Loharu, while

                  appellant Raj Kumar is son of Raghbir Bairagi resident of Ladonda,

                  District Jhunjhunu. He further submitted that concededly nothing

                  was recovered from the appellant and merely running away from

                  the spot would not give rise to the presumption with regard to

                  involvement of the appellant, Raj Kumar, in the crime. He further

                  submitted that even if the whole case of the prosecution is taken in

                  its entirety then also the culpability of appellant Raj Kumar has not

                  been established by the prosecution. 
In support of his contentions,

                  learned counsel has placed reliance on 
Narinder Singh vs. State of

                  Punjab
, 1997(1) RCR(Criminal) 592.




                  25.              Shri K.S. Godara, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Surender Kumar @ Sunder has submitted that except the

                  deposition of the official witnesses, there is no other material to

                  connect the appellant with the alleged crime. He further submitted

                  that         the learned   trial   court   while   delivering   the   impugned

                  judgement failed to discuss the depositions of DW1 and DW2,

                  therefore, the judgement without discussing the entire evidence is

                  bad in law. He further submitted that no test identification parade

                  of the appellants was got conducted by the investigating agency,

                  therefore, the oral version of the police officials that the appellants

                  ran away from the spot would not be sufficient to hold them guilty

                  for such a serious offence.



                  26.              Shri G.S. Kaura, learned counsel representing appellant

                  Karan Singh submitted that there is not an iota of word against the

                  appellant, Karan Singh, to the effect that either he was present on

                  the spot or in any manner connected with Surender Kumar, Raj

                  Kumar and Pardeep Kumar, his co-convicts. He further contended

                  that even the name of appellant Karan Singh was not found

                  mentioned in the FIR.    Therefore, the conviction and sentence of

                  appellant Karan Singh is without any basis.      He also argued that

                  during investigation, the investigating agency had recorded the

                  statement of PW3-Rajesh to the effect that Karan Singh suffered

                  extra-judicial confession before him and he had failed to support

                  the prosecution case when he appeared as PW3 and even after

                  lengthy cross-examination by the Public Prosecutor nothing could

                  be brought on record showing the involvement of appellant Karan

                  Singh.



                  27.          On the other hand, learned counsel for the State while

                  controverting the submissions of Mr.Sidakamat Sidhu, Advocate

                  representing the appellant Pardeep Kumar submitted that as soon

                  as the secret information was received by Sub Inspector Hanuman

                  Singh, PW18, the same was reduced into writing and the senior

                  officers of the police were informed, therefore, it does not lie in his

                  mouth to say that there was non-compliance of 
Section 42
 of the

                  NDPS Act. He further submitted that the deposition of the official

                  witnesses is so clear and without pointing out any infirmity in their

                  depositions, it cannot be said that while discarding the same, the

                  appellants should be acquitted merely on the ground that no

                  independent witness was joined. He further submitted that it is the

                  quality and not the quantity which should matter with the Court

                  while appreciating the evidence and as such the submission of the

                  learned counsel for the appellants that no independent witness

                  from the public was joined to witness the recovery would not affect

                  the well reasoned judgment recorded by the learned trial court.


                  28.          I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with

                  their able assistance gone through the material available on record.


                  29.          In the case in hand, the appellants can be categorized as

                  under:-



                               (i)     The appellant who was arrested from the spot with

                               the heroin


                               (ii)    the appellants ran away from the spot after seeing

                               the police party; and


                               (iii)   the appellant whose name was neither mentioned

                               in the FIR nor he ran away at the spot and only

                               allegation against whom was that he suffered extra-


                               judicial   confession   admitting   his   guilt   before   the

                               witnesses.



                  30.          The case of appellant Pardeep Kumar would fall in the

                  first category since he was apprehended from the spot and on

                  search 770 grams of heroin was recovered from his personal

                  search. Even the motorcycle make Bajaj on which he was sitting

                  was also taken into possession. After apprehending the appellant,

                  Pardeep Kumar, notice under 
Section 50
 of the NDPS Act was

                  issued by SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18). Pardeep Kumar posed faith

                  in Harish Dutta, Deputy Superintendent of Police, (PW-12) and

                  thereafter the search was conducted and a small bag of cloth

                  containing heroin was recovered from the pocket of his pants. Two

                  samples each of 10 grams were drawn from the bulk and converted

                  into sealed parcel.   The residue heroin was weighed and it was

                  found to be 750 grams and the same was also converted into a

                  sealed parcels. The seal, after use, was handed over to ASI Kailash

                  Chander (PW-17). Harish Dutta, Deputy Superintendent of Police,

                  (PW-12), ASI Kailash Chander (PW-17) and SI Hanuman Singh (PW-


                  18) fully supported the prosecution case and there was nothing to

                  disbelieve the depositions of the said witnesses. With regard to the

                  arrest of appellant Pardeep Kumar from the spot and recovery of

                  770 grams of heroin from the pocket of his pants, the submission of

                  his learned counsel, Sh.Sidakamat Sidhu, that there was non-

                  compliance of 
Section 42
 of the NDPS Act since no information

                  regarding receipt of secret information was reduced into writing

                  and no senior police official was informed regarding the receipt of

                  such secret information is not tenable being factually wrong. It was

                  specifically deposed by SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18) that after

                  receipt of the secret information, report No.5 was entered in the

                  Daily Diary Register and a copy thereof was sent to the

                  Superintendent of Police, Fatehabad, through Constable Gordhan

                  Singh, therefore, the learned trial court had rightly held the

                  appellant, Pardeep Kumar, guilty for the offence punishable under

                  
Section 21
 of the NDPS Act and awarded rigorous imprisonment for

                  ten years and to pay fine of ` 1,00,000/- and in default thereof, to

                  undergo further simple imprisonment for one year and as such, the

                  conviction and sentence of appellant Pardeep Kumar is maintained

                  by this Court.



 
31.          So far as the case of appellants Raj Kumar and Surender

                  Kumar @ Sunder is concerned, it would fall in the second category

                  (supra) since they were neither arrested from the spot nor any

                  contraband was recovered from their possession.           None of the

                  independent      witnesses   from   the    public   examined   by     the

                  prosecution had supported the prosecution case with regard to the

                  involvement of appellants Raj Kumar and             Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder.      The depositions of the police officials with regard to

                  identity of these two appellants cannot be accepted in view of the

                  glaring defects in that regard. Mere disclosure statement of the co-

                  accused of these appellant would not be sufficient to hold them

                  guilty for such a serious offence.        It was rightly argued by the

                  learned counsel of these appellants that even if the case of the

                  prosecution was accepted for the sake of discussion that Raj Kumar

                  and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) ran away from the spot

                  after seeing the police party, it would not lead to a conclusion that

                  they were in conscious possession of the alleged contraband and

                  had run away with a guilty mind.           Reference can be made to

                  
Narinder Singh
's     case (supra) where this Court held that mere

                  fleeing of accused on seeing the police party would not raise

                  presumption that they were in conscious possession of the

                  contraband.




                  32.          Concededly, no contraband was recovered from Raj

                  Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants); their identity is

                  also in dispute since no test identification parade was conducted

                  and none of the official witnesses had a previous acquaintance with

                  those appellants; it has not been proved on record by any evidence

                  that Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) had

                  prior association with Pardeep Kumar and that they were aware

                  that Pardeep Kumar was retaining a bag of cloth containing heroin

                  in the pocket of his pants, therefore, the conviction and sentence of

                  the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder as

                  recorded by the learned trial court, does not find favour with this

                  Court and by setting aside the judgment and the order of

                  conviction, the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder, are hereby acquitted.



                  33.           The case of the appellant, Karan Singh, would fall in the

                  third category (supra). There is not an iota of evidence connecting

                  him (Karan Singh) with the offences punishable under 
Section 27-A


                  and 
29
 of the NDPS Act for which he was held guilty and awarded

                  rigorous imprisonment for ten years for each count. For holding a

                  person guilty for the offence punishable under 
Section 27-A
 of the

                  NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant was

                  indulging in financing, directly or indirectly, for any of the activities

                  specified in sub-clause (i) to (v) of Clause (viii-a) of 
Section 2
 or

                  harboured any person engaged in any of the aforementioned

                  activities.

                  34.          Similarly for holding a person guilty under 
Section 29
 of

                  the NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant

                  abetted or was a party to criminal conspiracy to commit an offence

                  punishable under 
Chapter IV of the NDPS Act
, whether such offence

                  be or be not committed in consequence of such abetment or in

                  pursuance of such criminal conspiracy.



                  35.          Perusal of the deposition of the prosecution witnesses

                  would reveals that not an iota of word had emerged on record to

                  attract the essential ingredients of 
Sections 27-A
 and 
29
 of the

                  NDPS Act to hold the appellant guilty for commission of the said

                  offences, therefore, the conviction and sentence of the appellant,

                  Karan Singh, is also set aside, and by allowing his appeal, he is

                  acquitted of the charges levelled against him.


                  36.          To sum up, appeal bearing No.S-747-SB of 2009 filed by

                  Pardeep Kumar is hereby dismissed and CRA-S-424-SB-2009 of

                  appellant Raj Kumar, CRA-S-695-SB-2009 of Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder and CRA-S-1051-SB of 2009 of Karan Singh are allowed and

                  they are acquitted of the charges levelled against them. The fine, if

                  deposited by the appellants who have been acquitted, would be

                  returned to them.

                  appellant Pardeep Kumar was doubtful and benefit of the same

                  therefore, the judgement without discussing the entire evidence is

                  bad in law. He further submitted that no test identification parade

                  of the appellants was got conducted by the investigating agency,

                  therefore, the oral version of the police officials that the appellants

                  that even the name of appellant Karan Singh was not found

                  extra-judicial confession before him and he had failed to support

                  controverting the submissions of Mr.Sidakamat Sidhu, Advocate

                  representing the appellant Pardeep Kumar submitted that as soon

                  as the secret information was received by Sub Inspector Hanuman

                  Singh, PW18, the same was reduced into writing and the senior

                  officers of the police were informed, therefore, it does not lie in his

                  mouth to say that there was non-compliance ofSection 42of the

                  NDPS Act. He further submitted that the deposition of the official

                  witnesses is so clear and without pointing out any infirmity in their

                  depositions, it cannot be said that while discarding the same, the

                  appellants should be acquitted merely on the ground that no

                  independent witness was joined. He further submitted that it is the

                  quality and not the quantity which should matter with the Court

                  thereafter the search was conducted and a small bag of cloth

                  compliance ofSection 42of the NDPS Act since no information

                  regarding receipt of secret information was reduced into writing

                  and no senior police official was informed regarding the receipt of

                  such secret information is not tenable being factually wrong. It was

                  specifically deposed by SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18) that after

                  receipt of the secret information, report No.5 was entered in the

                  Daily Diary Register and a copy thereof was sent to the

                  appellant, Pardeep Kumar, guilty for the offence punishable underSection 21of the NDPS Act and awarded rigorous imprisonment for

                  ten years and to pay fine of ` 1,00,000/- and in default thereof, to

                  by this Court.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_43, Content: 31.          So far as the case of appellants Raj Kumar and Surender

                  Kumar @ Sunder is concerned, it would fall in the second category

                  (supra) since they were neither arrested from the spot nor any

                  contraband was recovered from their possession.           None of the

                  independent      witnesses   from   the    public   examined   by     the

                  prosecution had supported the prosecution case with regard to the

                  involvement of appellants Raj Kumar and             Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder.      The depositions of the police officials with regard to

                  identity of these two appellants cannot be accepted in view of the

                  glaring defects in that regard. Mere disclosure statement of the co-

                  accused of these appellant would not be sufficient to hold them

                  guilty for such a serious offence.        It was rightly argued by the

                  learned counsel of these appellants that even if the case of the

                  prosecution was accepted for the sake of discussion that Raj Kumar

                  and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) ran away from the spot

                  after seeing the police party, it would not lead to a conclusion that

                  they were in conscious possession of the alleged contraband and

                  had run away with a guilty mind.           Reference can be made toNarinder Singh's     case (supra) where this Court held that mere

                  fleeing of accused on seeing the police party would not raise

                  presumption that they were in conscious possession of the

                  contraband.

                  also in dispute since no test identification parade was conducted

                  and none of the official witnesses had a previous acquaintance with

                  those appellants; it has not been proved on record by any evidence

                  that Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) had

                  prior association with Pardeep Kumar and that they were aware

                  that Pardeep Kumar was retaining a bag of cloth containing heroin

                  in the pocket of his pants, therefore, the conviction and sentence of

                  the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder as

                  recorded by the learned trial court, does not find favour with this

                  Court and by setting aside the judgment and the order of

                  conviction, the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder, are hereby acquitted.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_45, Content: 33.           The case of the appellant, Karan Singh, would fall in the

                  third category (supra). There is not an iota of evidence connecting

                  him (Karan Singh) with the offences punishable underSection 27-Aand29of the NDPS Act for which he was held guilty and awarded

                  rigorous imprisonment for ten years for each count. For holding a

                  person guilty for the offence punishable underSection 27-Aof the

                  NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant was

                  indulging in financing, directly or indirectly, for any of the activities

                  specified in sub-clause (i) to (v) of Clause (viii-a) ofSection 2or

                  harboured any person engaged in any of the aforementioned

                  activities.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_46, Content: 34.          Similarly for holding a person guilty underSection 29of

                  the NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant

                  abetted or was a party to criminal conspiracy to commit an offence

                  punishable underChapter IV of the NDPS Act, whether such offence

                  be or be not committed in consequence of such abetment or in

                  pursuance of such criminal conspiracy.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_47, Content: 35.          Perusal of the deposition of the prosecution witnesses

                  would reveals that not an iota of word had emerged on record to

                  attract the essential ingredients ofSections 27-Aand29of the

                  NDPS Act to hold the appellant guilty for commission of the said

                  offences, therefore, the conviction and sentence of the appellant,

                  Karan Singh, is also set aside, and by allowing his appeal, he is

                  acquitted of the charges levelled against him.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_48, Content: 36.          To sum up, appeal bearing No.S-747-SB of 2009 filed by

                  Pardeep Kumar is hereby dismissed and CRA-S-424-SB-2009 of

                  they are acquitted of the charges levelled against them. The fine, if

                  deposited by the appellants who have been acquitted, would be

                  returned to them.

                                 called by Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh, he went to join

                                 the investigation at Fatehabad on 07.12.2006.          The

                                 witness disclosed to the Sub Inspector that he had gone

                                 to Madhuban from District Rewari to attend VIP Security

                                 Force and 13 persons attended the course. Karan Singh

                                 was one of them. On 13.11.2006, the witness had gone

                                 for one day leave and while going he gave his mobile

                                 Nokia 1100 to Karan Singh and took away mobile 6681

                                 from Karan Singh but both of them used their respective

                                 sim cards. After return to Madhuban on 14.11.2006, he

                                 Prosecutor could not bring anything in favour of the

                                 prosecution.16.            After completion of the oral evidence of the prosecution,

                  the learned Public Prosecutor tendered the FSL report (Ex.P-54) to

                  be read in evidence and closed the evidence of the prosecution.17.            The statements of the appellants in terms ofSection

                                    case."18.          Appellant Pardeep simply said that he was innocent and

                  was falsely implicated in this case.19.          Appellant Raj Kumar in response to question No.16

                  stated as under :-"I am innocent. My name is not mentioned in the

                                    political pressure and considerations he had been

                                    implicated in this case by the police.   I have no
                                    concern with the alleged occurrence. I have been
                                    falsely implicated."20.               Appellant karan Singh also denied the incriminating

                  material put against him but in response to question No.16 he

                  stated as under :-"I am innocent. I was appointed as SI in Haryana

                               paid to him then his brother would be got discharged

                               demanded ` 2,00,000/- from the witness but he showed

                               his inability to pay the amount. When the witness told

                               that he could arrange ` 30,000/- then Sub Inspector

                               Hanuman Singh directed him to come with money at

                               Fatehabad and thereafter he (witness) went to his place

                               of posting at Jhunjhunu. On 28.11.2006, Sub Inspector

                               Hanuman Singh visited the place of posting of the

                               witness Pawan Kumar and put pressure on him but at

                               the asking of the senior officers at the office of the

                               witness Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh came back. While

                               carrying the money otherwise his brother would not be

                               Inspector   Hanuman   Singh   was   insisting   to   bring

                               ` 30,000/- and the said conversation was recorded by

                               Pawan Kumar on his mobile phone.       He produced his

                               voice of Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh. The witness further

                               deposed that Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh pressurized

                               accused Raj Kumar to ask the witness to pay ` 30,000/-. It

                               was further deposed that there was yet another Raj

                               Kumar, who was left by Sub Inspector Hanuman Singh

                               while his brother Raj Kumar was implicated.22.          After completion of the evidence of both the sides,

                  arguments were heard and the learned trial court held the four

                  appellants guilty and awarded the sentences as has been discussed

                  in the earlier part of this judgement.23.          Mr. Sidakamat Sidhu, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Pardeep Kumar argued that there was non-compliance ofSection 42of the NDPS Act since receipt of the secret information

                  was not reduced into writing and no information regarding the

                  same was sent to the senior police officers. He further argued that

                  no independent witness was joined to witness the recovery.

                  Therefore, the whole case propounded by the prosecution qua

                  appellant Pardeep Kumar was doubtful and benefit of the same

                  should be extended to him.24.          Shri Sudhir Sharma, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Raj Kumar submitted that the identity of appellant Raj

                  Kumar has not been established in the present case since the name

                  mentioned in the FIR was of Raj Kumar Jat resident of Loharu, while

                  appellant Raj Kumar is son of Raghbir Bairagi resident of Ladonda,

                  District Jhunjhunu. He further submitted that concededly nothingSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)
                  & connected appeals                                                    -23-



                  was recovered from the appellant and merely running away from

                  the spot would not give rise to the presumption with regard to

                  involvement of the appellant, Raj Kumar, in the crime. He further

                  submitted that even if the whole case of the prosecution is taken in

                  its entirety then also the culpability of appellant Raj Kumar has not

                  been established by the prosecution.In support of his contentions,

                  learned counsel has placed reliance onNarinder Singh vs. State of

                  Punjab, 1997(1) RCR(Criminal) 592.25.              Shri K.S. Godara, learned counsel representing the

                  appellant Surender Kumar @ Sunder has submitted that except the

                  deposition of the official witnesses, there is no other material to

                  connect the appellant with the alleged crime. He further submitted

                  that         the learned   trial   court   while   delivering   the   impugned

                  judgement failed to discuss the depositions of DW1 and DW2,

                  therefore, the judgement without discussing the entire evidence is

                  bad in law. He further submitted that no test identification parade

                  of the appellants was got conducted by the investigating agency,

                  therefore, the oral version of the police officials that the appellants

                  ran away from the spot would not be sufficient to hold them guilty

                  for such a serious offence.26.              Shri G.S. Kaura, learned counsel representing appellant

                  Karan Singh submitted that there is not an iota of word against the

                  appellant, Karan Singh, to the effect that either he was present on

                  the spot or in any manner connected with Surender Kumar, Raj

                  Kumar and Pardeep Kumar, his co-convicts. He further contendedSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)
                  & connected appeals                                          -24-



                  that even the name of appellant Karan Singh was not found

                  mentioned in the FIR.    Therefore, the conviction and sentence of

                  appellant Karan Singh is without any basis.      He also argued that

                  during investigation, the investigating agency had recorded the

                  statement of PW3-Rajesh to the effect that Karan Singh suffered

                  extra-judicial confession before him and he had failed to support

                  the prosecution case when he appeared as PW3 and even after

                  lengthy cross-examination by the Public Prosecutor nothing could

                  be brought on record showing the involvement of appellant Karan

                  Singh.27.          On the other hand, learned counsel for the State while

                  controverting the submissions of Mr.Sidakamat Sidhu, Advocate

                  representing the appellant Pardeep Kumar submitted that as soon

                  as the secret information was received by Sub Inspector Hanuman

                  Singh, PW18, the same was reduced into writing and the senior

                  officers of the police were informed, therefore, it does not lie in his

                  mouth to say that there was non-compliance ofSection 42of the

                  NDPS Act. He further submitted that the deposition of the official

                  witnesses is so clear and without pointing out any infirmity in their

                  depositions, it cannot be said that while discarding the same, the

                  appellants should be acquitted merely on the ground that no

                  independent witness was joined. He further submitted that it is the

                  quality and not the quantity which should matter with the Court

                  while appreciating the evidence and as such the submission of the

                  learned counsel for the appellants that no independent witnessSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)
                  & connected appeals                                              -25-



                  from the public was joined to witness the recovery would not affect

                  the well reasoned judgment recorded by the learned trial court.28.          I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with

                  their able assistance gone through the material available on record.29.          In the case in hand, the appellants can be categorized as

                  under:-(i)     The appellant who was arrested from the spot with

                               the heroin(ii)    the appellants ran away from the spot after seeing

                               the police party; and(iii)   the appellant whose name was neither mentioned

                               in the FIR nor he ran away at the spot and only

                               allegation against whom was that he suffered extra-judicial   confession   admitting   his   guilt   before   the

                               witnesses.30.          The case of appellant Pardeep Kumar would fall in the

                  first category since he was apprehended from the spot and on

                  search 770 grams of heroin was recovered from his personal

                  search. Even the motorcycle make Bajaj on which he was sitting

                  was also taken into possession. After apprehending the appellant,

                  Pardeep Kumar, notice underSection 50of the NDPS Act was

                  issued by SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18). Pardeep Kumar posed faith

                  in Harish Dutta, Deputy Superintendent of Police, (PW-12) and

                  thereafter the search was conducted and a small bag of cloth

                  containing heroin was recovered from the pocket of his pants. TwoSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)

                  samples each of 10 grams were drawn from the bulk and converted

                  into sealed parcel.   The residue heroin was weighed and it was

                  found to be 750 grams and the same was also converted into a

                  sealed parcels. The seal, after use, was handed over to ASI Kailash

                  Chander (PW-17). Harish Dutta, Deputy Superintendent of Police,

                  (PW-12), ASI Kailash Chander (PW-17) and SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18) fully supported the prosecution case and there was nothing to

                  disbelieve the depositions of the said witnesses. With regard to the

                  arrest of appellant Pardeep Kumar from the spot and recovery of

                  770 grams of heroin from the pocket of his pants, the submission of

                  his learned counsel, Sh.Sidakamat Sidhu, that there was non-

                  compliance ofSection 42of the NDPS Act since no information

                  regarding receipt of secret information was reduced into writing

                  and no senior police official was informed regarding the receipt of

                  such secret information is not tenable being factually wrong. It was

                  specifically deposed by SI Hanuman Singh (PW-18) that after

                  receipt of the secret information, report No.5 was entered in the

                  Daily Diary Register and a copy thereof was sent to the

                  Superintendent of Police, Fatehabad, through Constable Gordhan

                  Singh, therefore, the learned trial court had rightly held the

                  appellant, Pardeep Kumar, guilty for the offence punishable underSection 21of the NDPS Act and awarded rigorous imprisonment for

                  ten years and to pay fine of ` 1,00,000/- and in default thereof, to

                  undergo further simple imprisonment for one year and as such, the

                  conviction and sentence of appellant Pardeep Kumar is maintainedSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)
                  & connected appeals                                            -27-



                  by this Court.31.          So far as the case of appellants Raj Kumar and Surender

                  Kumar @ Sunder is concerned, it would fall in the second category

                  (supra) since they were neither arrested from the spot nor any

                  contraband was recovered from their possession.           None of the

                  independent      witnesses   from   the    public   examined   by     the

                  prosecution had supported the prosecution case with regard to the

                  involvement of appellants Raj Kumar and             Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder.      The depositions of the police officials with regard to

                  identity of these two appellants cannot be accepted in view of the

                  glaring defects in that regard. Mere disclosure statement of the co-

                  accused of these appellant would not be sufficient to hold them

                  guilty for such a serious offence.        It was rightly argued by the

                  learned counsel of these appellants that even if the case of the

                  prosecution was accepted for the sake of discussion that Raj Kumar

                  and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) ran away from the spot

                  after seeing the police party, it would not lead to a conclusion that

                  they were in conscious possession of the alleged contraband and

                  had run away with a guilty mind.           Reference can be made toNarinder Singh's     case (supra) where this Court held that mere

                  fleeing of accused on seeing the police party would not raise

                  presumption that they were in conscious possession of the

                  contraband.32.          Concededly, no contraband was recovered from Raj

                  Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants); their identity isSharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)

                  also in dispute since no test identification parade was conducted

                  and none of the official witnesses had a previous acquaintance with

                  those appellants; it has not been proved on record by any evidence

                  that Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) had

                  prior association with Pardeep Kumar and that they were aware

                  that Pardeep Kumar was retaining a bag of cloth containing heroin

                  in the pocket of his pants, therefore, the conviction and sentence of

                  the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @ Sunder as

                  recorded by the learned trial court, does not find favour with this

                  Court and by setting aside the judgment and the order of

                  conviction, the appellants, Raj Kumar and Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder, are hereby acquitted.33.           The case of the appellant, Karan Singh, would fall in the

                  third category (supra). There is not an iota of evidence connecting

                  him (Karan Singh) with the offences punishable underSection 27-Aand29of the NDPS Act for which he was held guilty and awarded

                  rigorous imprisonment for ten years for each count. For holding a

                  person guilty for the offence punishable underSection 27-Aof the

                  NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant was

                  indulging in financing, directly or indirectly, for any of the activities

                  specified in sub-clause (i) to (v) of Clause (viii-a) ofSection 2or

                  harboured any person engaged in any of the aforementioned

                  activities.Sharma Seema2014.03.06 16:51I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentChandigarhCRA-S-747-SB-2009 (O&M)
                  & connected appeals                                          -29-34.          Similarly for holding a person guilty underSection 29of

                  the NDPS Act, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant

                  abetted or was a party to criminal conspiracy to commit an offence

                  punishable underChapter IV of the NDPS Act, whether such offence

                  be or be not committed in consequence of such abetment or in

                  pursuance of such criminal conspiracy.35.          Perusal of the deposition of the prosecution witnesses

                  would reveals that not an iota of word had emerged on record to

                  attract the essential ingredients ofSections 27-Aand29of the

                  NDPS Act to hold the appellant guilty for commission of the said

                  offences, therefore, the conviction and sentence of the appellant,

                  Karan Singh, is also set aside, and by allowing his appeal, he is

                  acquitted of the charges levelled against him.36.          To sum up, appeal bearing No.S-747-SB of 2009 filed by

                  Pardeep Kumar is hereby dismissed and CRA-S-424-SB-2009 of

                  appellant Raj Kumar, CRA-S-695-SB-2009 of Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder and CRA-S-1051-SB of 2009 of Karan Singh are allowed and

                  they are acquitted of the charges levelled against them. The fine, if

                  deposited by the appellants who have been acquitted, would be

                  returned to them.(NARESH KUMAR SANGHI)

Tag: span, Class: citetext, ID: span_127, Content: 31.          So far as the case of appellants Raj Kumar and Surender

                  Kumar @ Sunder is concerned, it would fall in the second category

                  (supra) since they were neither arrested from the spot nor any

                  contraband was recovered from their possession.           None of the

                  independent      witnesses   from   the    public   examined   by     the

                  prosecution had supported the prosecution case with regard to the

                  involvement of appellants Raj Kumar and             Surender Kumar @

                  Sunder.      The depositions of the police officials with regard to

                  identity of these two appellants cannot be accepted in view of the

                  glaring defects in that regard. Mere disclosure statement of the co-

                  accused of these appellant would not be sufficient to hold them

                  guilty for such a serious offence.        It was rightly argued by the

                  learned counsel of these appellants that even if the case of the

                  prosecution was accepted for the sake of discussion that Raj Kumar

                  and Surender Kumar @ Sunder (appellants) ran away from the spot

                  after seeing the police party, it would not lead to a conclusion that

                  they were in conscious possession of the alleged contraband and

                  had run away with a guilty mind.           Reference can be made toNarinder Singh's     case (supra) where this Court held that mere

                  fleeing of accused on seeing the police party would not raise

                  presumption that they were in conscious possession of the

                  contraband.
