CORAM:-    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.J. VAZIFDAR, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE
           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN PALLI

Present:   Mr. R.S. Rangpuri, Advocate for the petitioner
           Mr. Rajinder Goyal, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab
           Mr. Anish Batra, Advocate for respondent Nos.2 to 4
                ..



S.J. VAZIFDAR, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE:



           One Gian Singh carries on business in the firm name

and style of the petitioner and as the sole proprietor

thereof.



2.         The petitioner has sought a writ of certiorari to

quash an order dated 28.04.2014 passed by respondent No.1, an

order dated 30.04.2013 and an order dated 18.10.2011 passed by

respondent No.3 whereby its claim for the allotment of a

plot/shop site in the New Grain Market on a preferential basis

has been rejected. The petitioner has also sought a writ of

certiorari to quash a notification dated 17.01.2014 by which

an explanation to Rule 3(iii) of the Punjab State Agricultural

Marketing Board (Sale and Transfer of Plots) Rules, 1999

(hereinafter to be referred to as "the 1999 rules") has been

inserted. The petitioner has sought a consequential order

directing the respondents to allot in his favour a shop in the

New Grain Market. The petitioner claims to be entitled to a

plot/shop in the New Grain Market on the basis of his having

been a licensee in the old grain market.



3.        The case in brief is this. The petitioner was a

licensee in the old grain market, which was de-notified. He

also carried on his business from a notified sub-yard. Upon

de-notification of the principal market yard, the petitioner

claims to be entitled, under a policy of the State of Punjab,

to be allotted premises in the New Grain Market. One of the

conditions of eligibility for allotment of premises in the New

Grain Market was that the licensee should have transacted

business of sale and purchase of agricultural produce for an

amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per annum during the last three

years. The petitioner would be eligible only if his business

in the de-notified principal market yard is clubbed with the

business transacted at the notified sub-yard. The respondents,

however, contend that such clubbing is not permissible while

determining the volume of business transacted by the licensee.


4.        The first question, therefore, is whether the main

part of Rule-3 of the 1999 rules permitted clubbing. We have

come to the conclusion that Rule-3 permitted such clubbing.


          By an amendment, an explanation was inserted which

did not permit clubbing. The second question, therefore, is

whether the explanation is retrospective or only prospective.

We have come to the conclusion that the explanation is

prospective for it affects the substantive rights of parties.


5.        A licence dated 09.12.2002 was issued in favour of

the petitioner which was valid till 31.03.2005. It was renewed

lastly up to 31.03.2011. The licence was issued in respect of

several trades including as a merchant, Kacha Arhtia, Arhtia,

godown keeper, processor and for sale and purchase. The

licence stipulated Shop No.1723, Grain Market, Gidderbaha, as

the place of trade.



6.        On       10.01.2008,        respondent       No.2-Punjab   State

Marketing Board (Punjab Mandi Board) invited applications from

licensees of the Old Grain Market for allotment of plot/shop

sites in the New Grain Market in accordance with the

provisions of the said 1999 rules as amended up to 2008. The

petitioner applied for the same. Respondent No.2, by a letter

dated 23.05.2011, stated that the petitioner did not fulfil

several conditions. The petitioner was afforded an opportunity

of replying to this notice which he did by his letter dated

04.06.2011.



7.        By an order dated 18.10.2011, passed by respondent

No.3-Estate Officer, Punjab Mandi Board, the petitioner was

declared ineligible for the allotment of a plot on the ground

that the petitioner had not carried on the business of Kacha

Arhtia at the Old Grain Market from 10.01.2005 to 09.01.2008

and that the petitioner's claim of having transacted business

of Rs.5 lacs per year during the previous three years at the

old market did not tally with the record of the Market

Committee. It was held, therefore, that the petitioner did not

fulfil the condition of having transacted business of at least

Rs.5 lacs per annum for the period of three years preceding

the date of the demand of applications i.e. 10.01.2008. The

application was, therefore, rejected on the ground that the

petitioner did not fulfil the criteria stipulated in Rule

3(iii) of the said 1999 rules.



8.           Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules, as it stood

prior to the amendment which introduced the explanation, read

as under:-

             "3.Sale of plots.-[Sections 43 and 18 of Punjab Act 23
             of 1961] All plots in the markets developed by the
             Board or committee shall be disposed of by way of open
             auction or allotment in accordance with the provisions
             of these rules.



                   Provided that not more than fifty per cent of the
             available plots shall be disposed of by way of allotment
             and the process of allotment shall be completed before
             conducting the sale by auction.



                   Provided further that the plots will be allowed to
             the licensed dealers of old market which are de-notified
             resulting in displacement of such licensed dealers on
             free-hold basis for conducting business of purchase of
             (sic) sale of agricultural produce in the new markets on
             the following terms and conditions, namely:-



             (i). .....



             (ii) . ....



             (iii) Only those licensees shall be eligible for
                   allotment of plots on the price, specified in
                   clauses (i) and (ii), who have been granted
                   licenses in the old de-notified markets for a
                   minimum period of three years before the date of
                   allotment. Such licenses must have submitted
                   returns in Form M appended to the Punjab
                   Agricultural Produce Markets (General) Rules, 1962
                   for all three years or such licensee shall have to
                   furnish adequate proof of working in the de-

                 notified old markets. In accordance with the
                 provisions of Form 'H' and Form 'J' as specified
                 in the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets
                 (General) Rules, 1962 read with the provisions of
                 Form "F', as specified in the bye-laws of the
                 Market Committee for the aforesaid period of three
                 years.   The period of three years referred to
                 above shall be counted with effect from the date
                 of notice inviting applications for allotment.

                Provided that only those licensees shall be
          eligible for allotment of plots, who have transacted the
          business of sale and purchase of agricultural produce
          for an amount, not less than five lacs rupees per annum
          during the last three years."



9.        The petitioner's appeal against the order was

disposed of by an order of the appellate authority dated

24.07.2012. The matter was remanded to the Estate Officer with

a direction to pass a speaking order afresh. The order also

stated that the appeal was disposed of in terms of an order

dated 24.07.2012 passed in another appeal in the case of M/s

Kisan Pesticides, Gidderbaha, stating that the case was

identical to the present case.



10.       The order in M/s Kisan Pesticide's appeal has been

furnished. It appears that in that case the allegations were

made that through collusion the figures of the extent of

business were manipulated in connivance with certain officers.

There was a direction, therefore, for a proper investigation

to be carried out.



          In the present writ petition, the respondents have

not contended that the figures have been manipulated. It has

only been contended that the business carried on in the sub-

market yard, etc. cannot be clubbed with the business carried

out in the principal market.

11.         Upon remand, the Estate Officer, respondent No.3

once again rejected the petitioner's application on the ground

that the petitioner had not fulfilled the condition of having

business transactions of Rs.5 lacs per annum from 10.01.2005

to    09.01.2008.    It   was    observed      that    a    Committee    was

constituted to examine the facts of the cases remanded by the

appellate authority and that the report of the Committee in

the petitioner's case tallied with the record of the Market

Committee. It was also observed that the petitioner's business

transactions during the relevant period were of the Purchase

Centre of Lalbai of the Market Committee and not of the

Principal   Market     Yard     of    the   Committee       and   that   the

transactions at the two locations could not be clubbed in

order to ascertain whether the petitioner fulfilled the

eligibility criteria under Rule 3 of the 1999 rules. The

petitioner's application was accordingly rejected.


12.         The applications of the other applicants, who were

also licensees in the old market, seeking similar benefits

under the same rules, were rejected. They challenged this

rejection by filing CWP No.20236 of 2011 titled as M/s 
Parkash

Chand Mehar Chand vs. State of Punjab and others
 and CWP

No.6127 of 2011 titled: M/s 
Brar Trading Company vs. State of

Punjab and others
, which were disposed of by an order and

judgment of the Division Bench dated 14.02.2013. The question

that fell for consideration was whether the value of the

business carried on by the petitioners therein in the Sub-

Market Yard can be added to the total value of the business

for the relevant years to determine their eligibility for

allotment of plots at a concessional rate in the new market.

The petitioners therein contended that a sub-yard is an

integral part of the principal market and both the businesses

are liable to be clubbed together.



          The respondents, on the other hand, denied this

contention and submitted that proof of requisite business is

to be determined on the basis of returns in Form-M, J-Form, I

and H-Register which are issued separately for the principal

market and sub-market yard. The Division Bench noted that as

per Rule 17(5) of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Market

(General) Rules, 1962 (for short, "the 1962 rules"), a

separate licence was required for establishing and continuing

the business at more than one place. It necessarily meant that

a separate licence was required for a sub-yard. It was further

noted that Rule 17(5) was omitted by a notification dated

30.03.1993 by the Punjab Government. After the notification,

the licence used for the principal market yard is valid to

carry on business in a sub-yard also. The Division Bench

disposed of the writ petition in the following terms:-


          "In the absence of an express exclusion clause in the
          Rules for not taking into account the business
          undertaken by a licenced firm in a sub-yard under the
          same licence which is granted for the old denotified
          grain market, we are of the considered view that the
          question of eligibility of firms like the petitioner
          requires re-determination by the rule making Authority,
          namely, the State Government in active consultation with
          the Punjab Mandi Board. Consequently and for the afore-
          stated purpose, these writ petitions are allowed to the
          extent that the order dated 15.2.2010 (Annexure P-9)
          passed by the State Government in exercise of its
          revisional powers under the Act is set aside and the
          matter is remitted to the Principal Secretary to

 CWP-15928-2014                                                          - 8 -



           Government of Punjab, Department of Agriculture, to take
           a uniform policy decision in prior consultation with the
           Punjab Mandi Board and then determine the eligibility of
           the petitioner or other similarly placed firms. The
           needful shall be done as early as possible preferably
           within a period of four months from the date of receipt
           of certified copy of this order."



13.        Subsequently, the Government of Punjab issued a

notification dated 17.01.2014 in exercise of powers under

Section 43 read with 
Section 18
 of the Punjab Agricultural

Produce Markets Act, 1961 ((hereinafter to be referred to as

"the 1961 Act"), whereby the Governor of Punjab made rules

further   to    amend    the    1999       rules   by   the   Punjab   State

Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale and Transfer of Plots)

(Amendment) Rules, 2014, which came into force with immediate

effect i.e. 17.01.2014. In Rule 3(iii), after the proviso, the

following explanation was inserted.

           "Explanation:    The transactions made by a
           licensee in a notified sub-yard or a purchase
           centre or any additional yard, as the case may be,
           shall not be clubbed with any transaction in a de-
           notified old market yard, for the purpose of
           computing the above amount, to determine the
           eligibility for allotment of a plot under these
           rules."



14.        If the explanation is applicable, the petitioner

would not be eligible to be allotted a plot in the New Grain

Market. Two questions, therefore, arise. The first is, whether

Rule 3(iii), as it stood prior to its amendment by the

insertion of the Explanation, permitted the clubbing of the

business at a notified sub-yard, etc. and the business carried

on in the de-notified old market yard. If the answer to this

question is in the negative, the petition is liable to be

dismissed    for    the    petitioner        would    then    admittedly        be

ineligible to be allotted a plot under the said 1999 rules.

If, however, the question is answered in the affirmative, the

next     question    would      be    whether        the    explanation        has

retrospective effect? If the explanation has retrospective

effect, the petitioner would certainly be ineligible. If not,

the petitioner would be eligible.



15.         The     petitioner       must,       therefore,         succeed     in

establishing that Rule 3(iii) prior to the amendment permitted

the transactions at notified sub-yards etc. to be clubbed with

the transactions at the de-notified old market yard and that

the Explanation has only prospective and not retrospective

effect.





16.         The first question, therefore, is whether Rule

3(iii)    prior     to    its   amendment        permitted    the     licensees

transactions in a notified sub-yard or a purchase centre or

any additional yard to be clubbed with the transactions in a

de-notified old market yard for the purpose of computing the

volume of business referred to in Rule 3(iii).


17.         
Sections 2(n)
 and 
7
 of the 1961 Act read as under:-


            "2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context

          7.    Declaration of market yards.- (1) For each notified
          market area, there shall be one principal market yard, one or
          more sub-market yards and one or more private market yards as
          may be necessary.



                (2) The State Government may, by notification, declare
          any enclosure, building or locality in any notified market
          area to be principal market yard for the area and other
          enclosures, buildings or localities to be one or more sub-

          market yards or one or more private market yards for the
          area.



                (3) Every person or company or co-operative society, as
          the case may be, desiring to obtain a licence for private
          market yard, shall apply to such authority, in such manner
          and with such fee, as may be prescribed."



18.       We referred earlier to Rule 17(5) of the 1962 rules

and that, with effect from 30.03.1999, the requirement of a

separate licence to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. was

done away with. The first requirement under Rule 3(iii) of the

1999 rules, to be eligible for allotment of a plot in the new

market, is that a licensee had been granted a licence in the

old de-notified market. That the petitioner had. With effect

from 30.03.1999, it was not necessary for a person to obtain a

separate licence for operating from a notified sub-market

yard, etc. A licence in respect of the principal market yard

entitled a person to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. as

well.



19.       The proviso to Rule 3(iii) stipulates that only

those licensees shall be eligible for allotment who had

transacted business for an amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per

annum during the last three years. It did not stipulate the

location from which such business had been transacted. The

business transacted from an authorised, to wit a notified sub-

market yard, etc., would fall within the ambit of the proviso



                              10 of 22

to Rule 3(iii). A view to the contrary would require the

proviso to be re-written by adding to it the words "from the

principal     market"       after    the       words   "Provided    only   those

licensees shall be eligible for allotment of plots, who have

transacted the business of sale and purchase of agricultural

produce ...... .... ." The purpose of Rule 3 was to re-locate and

accommodate the licensees of the old de-notified grain market

in the new grain market on account of the old grain market

being de-notified. The sub-yards, etc. have not been de-

notified. The petitioner would, therefore, be entitled to

continue to operate from the notified sub-yards. They would,

however, cease operating from the de-notified principal market

yard in any event upon being allotted premises in the new

market yard.



20.           In the circumstances, prior to the amendment of Rule

3(iii) by the insertion of the Explanation thereto, in

determining the volume of an applicant's business, the value

of the transactions at a notified sub-yard or a purchase

centre   or     any     additional         yard    could   be    clubbed    with

transactions in the old market yard from where the applicant

operated under a valid licence prior to its de-notification.


21.           This brings us to the question as to whether the

Explanation is retrospective or only prospective.


22.           There    is     a     presumption        against     retrospective

operation of a statute. A statute which affects substantive

rights is presumed to be prospective in operation unless it is

made retrospective expressly or by necessary intendment.

Further, if the enactment is capable of either interpretation,

it ought to be construed as being prospective and not

retrospective. It is sufficient, in this regard, to merely

note the judgment of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme

Court in 
Shyam Sunder and another vs. Ram Kumar and another
,

(2001)8 SCC 24.




23.        We do not find the explanation to be retrospective.

It is certainly not made retrospective expressly. The plain

language does not suggest that it is retrospective. Nor do we

find it to be retrospective by necessary intendment. The

language of the explanation does not indicate it to be

clarificatory     of   the   Rule     as   it   stood.     Nor   does    the

explanation remove the basis for the interpretation of the

section.



24.        Mr. Goyal relied upon the following observations of
the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Shyam Sunder's
case (supra) to contend that the explanation introduced by an
amendment must always and of necessity be considered to have
retrospective effect:-

           "42. G.P.     Singh   on    Principles    of  Statutory
           Interpretation quoting Craies stated thus:

                 "For modern purposes a declaratory Act may be
                 defined as an Act to remove doubts existing as to
                 the common law, or the meaning or effect of any
                 statute. Such Acts are usually held to be
                 retrospective. The usual reason for passing a
                 declaratory Act is to set aside what Parliament
                 deems to have been a judicial error, whether in
                 the statement of the common law or in the
                 interpretation of statutes. Usually, if not
                 invariably, such an Act contains a preamble, and
                 also the word "declared" as well as the word
                 "enacted".' But the use of the words 'it is

             ::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::

 CWP-15928-2014                                                 - 13 -



                   declared' is not conclusive that the Act is
                   declaratory for these words may, at times, be used
                   to introduce new rules of law and the Act in the
                   latter case will only be amending the law and will
                   not necessarily be retrospective. In determining,
                   therefore, the nature of the Act, regard must be
                   had to the substance rather than to the form.



             If a new Act is 'to explain' an earlier Act, it would be
             without object unless construed retrospective. An
             explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious
             omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the
             previous Act. It is well settled that if a statute is
             curative or merely declaratory of the previous law
             retrospective operation is generally intended."



             43. 
In 
Keshavlal Jethalal Shah v. Mohanlal Bhagwandas
,
             1969 R.C.R. (Rent) 123: 1968(3) SCR 623, this Court
             while interpreting Section 29(2) of the amending Act,
             held thus:




                    "An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply
                   an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to
                   the meaning of the previous Act. Section 29(2)
                   before it was enacted was precise in its
                   implication as well as in its expression; the
                   meaning of the words used was not in doubt, and
                   there was no omission in its phraseology which was
                   required to be supplied by the amendment."



25.          It is important to note that in both the paragraphs,

the Supreme       Court     held that retrospectivity is to be

attributed in such cases "generally". We do not consider the

Supreme Court as having held that an explanation is always

clarificatory, curative or merely declaratory of the previous

law and, therefore, retrospective operation must always be

given to an explanation introduced to legislation by an

amendment.



26.          Mr. Goyal's reliance upon the judgment of three

learned Judges of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Zile Singh

vs. State of Haryana
, 2004(8) SCC 1, does not support his

contention either. He relied upon paragraph-13 which reads as

under:-

                 "13. It is a cardinal principle of construction
                 that every statute is prima facie prospective
                 unless it is expressly or by necessary implication
                 made to have a retrospective operation. But the
                 rule in general is applicable where the object of
                 the statute is to affect vested rights or to
                 impose new burdens or to impair existing
                 obligations. Unless there are words in the statute
                 sufficient to show the intention of the
                 legislature to affect existing rights, it is
                 deemed to be prospective only -- "nova constitutio
                 futuris formam imponere debet non praeteritis" -- a
                 new law ought to regulate what is to follow, not
                 the    past.   (See   Principles    of   Statutory
                 Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn.,
                 2004 at p. 438.) It is not necessary that an
                 express provision be made to make a statute
                 retrospective   and    the   presumption   against
                 retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary
                 implication especially in a case where the new law
                 is made to cure an acknowledged evil for the
                 benefit of the community as a whole (ibid., p.

                 440)."



          There is no doubt that the presumption against

retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary implication. The

question is whether the explanation in the case before us can

be said to be retrospective by necessary implication.


27.       The judgments, we will now refer to, were not cited

at the bar. We, therefore, invited the attention of the

Counsel to these judgments and invited their submissions in

respect thereof.

Act defined income "deemed to accrue or arise in India".


Section 9(1)(ii)
 provided that income which falls under the

head "salary", if it is earned in India, is included in such

income. To overcome a decision of the Gujarat High Court in


CIT vs. S.G. Pgnatale
, (1980) 124 ITR 391 (Guj), 
section

9(1)(ii)
 was amended by inserting the following explanation:-


          "Explanation.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
          declared that income of the nature referred to in this
          clause payable for service rendered in India shall be
          regarded as income earned in India."



          It is important to note that the explanation opened

with the words "For the removal of doubts .... ...... ......". In the

case before us, these words are absent. Despite the same, the

Supreme Court held that the explanation could not apply to

the previous assessment years. It was held as follows:-

 
"10. In our view the 1999 Explanation could not
          apply to assessment years for the simple reason that it
          had not come into effect then. Prior to introducing the
          1999 Explanation, the decision in 
CIT v. S.G. Pgnatale

          [(1980) 124 ITR 391 (Guj)] was followed in 1989 by a
          Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court in 
CIT v.
          Goslino Mario
 [(2000) 241 ITR 314 (Gau)] . It found that
          the 1983 Explanation had been given effect from 1-4-1979
          whereas the year in question 
in that case
 was 1976-77
          and said: (ITR p. 318)

                 "[I]t is settled law that assessment has to be
                 made with reference to the law which is in
                 existence at the relevant time. The mere fact that
                 the assessments in question has (sic) somehow
                 remained pending on 1-4-1979, cannot be cogent
                 reason to make the Explanation applicable to the
                 cases of the present assessees. This fortuitous
                 circumstance cannot take away the vested rights of
                 the assessees at hand."

                18. There was and is no ambiguity in the main
          provision of 
Section 9(1)(ii)
. It includes salaries in
          the total income of an assessee if the assessee has
          earned it in India. The word "earned" had been

           judicially defined in S.G. Pgnatale [(1980) 124 ITR 391
           (Guj)] by the High Court of Gujarat, in our view,
           correctly, to mean as income "arising or accruing in
           India". The amendment to the section by way of an
           Explanation in 1983 effected a change in the scope of
           that judicial definition so as to include with effect
           from 1979, "income payable for service rendered in
           India".



                 19. When the Explanation seeks to give an
           artificial meaning to "earned in India" and brings about
           a change effectively in the existing law and in addition
           is stated to come into force with effect from a future
           date, there is no principle of interpretation which
           would justify reading the Explanation as operating
           retrospectively."                     (emphasis supplied)

           This judgment clearly militates against Mr. Goyal's

extreme   proposition       that     an     explanation      always   has   a

retrospective effect. It also militates against his submission

that an explanation introduced by an amendment always and of

necessity only explains or clarifies what the main section

always meant.

In 
Government of Andhra Pradesh and another vs.

Court held:-




           "12. In construing a statutory provision, the first and
           foremost rule of construction is the literal
           construction. If the provision is unambiguous and if
           from that provision, the legislative intent is clear, we
           need not call into aid the other rules of construction.
           The other rules of construction are invoked when the
           legislative intent is not clear. 
In 
Bihta Co-op.
           Development and Cane Marketing Union Ltd. v. Bank of
           Bihar
 [AIR 1967 SC 389] this Court was called upon to
           consider Explanation to 
Section 48(1)
 of the Bihar and
           Orissa Cooperative Societies Act, 1935. This Court
           observed that the Court should not go only by the label.
           The Court observed that an explanation must be read
           ordinarily to clear up any ambiguity in the main section
           and it cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the
           section. However, if on a true reading of an Explanation
           it appears to the Court in a given case that the effect
           of the Explanation is to widen the scope of the main

          section then effect must be given to the legislative
          intent. It was held that in all such cases the Court has
          to find out the true intention of the legislature.
          Therefore, there is no single yardstick to decide
          whether an Explanation is enacted to clarify the
          ambiguity or whether it is enacted to widen the scope of
          the main section. On the facts it was held that before
          the 1948 
Amendment to the Bihar and Orissa Cooperative
          Societies Act, 1935
, there was an Explanation on the
          statute-book and the subsequent Explanation was only to
          clarify the earlier Explanation and, therefore, the
          Court held that the purpose of the subsequent
          Explanation was not to enlarge the scope of 
Section
          48(1)(e)
 in the 
Bihar and Orissa Cooperative Societies
          Act, 1935
. In the present case prior to amending Act 27
          of 1996, there was no Explanation covering banks, LICs,
          etc. As stated above, Explanation IV was added for the
          first time by the said amending Act 27 of 1996. The
          definition of the word "dealer" thus stands expanded by
          the said amending Act 27 of 1996. In our view,
          therefore, Explanation IV was not to clear any doubt or
          ambiguity. It has been enacted in order to expand the
          definition of the word "dealer" in 
Section 2(1)(e)
 of
          the 1957 Act."                        (emphasis supplied)

          An explanation is not necessarily or always to clear

a doubt or ambiguity. It can alter the scope and ambit of the

main section substantially. When, therefore, by an amendment

an explanation is added it would be necessary to examine

whether it affects the main section.



30.       In our view, if an explanation can expand a

definition, it can equally restrict it. In the case before us,

the explanation has restricted the eligibility criteria.

Further, if it can expand a definition, it can also expand any

other aspect of the definition. It would follow again that if

it can expand any other aspect of the enactment, it can

equally restrict it. This is what has been done by the

Explanation in Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules. The

explanation   has     restricted       the   eligibility    criteria   of

licensees of de-notified markets being entitled to premises in

the new market.



31.          Our view is supported by a judgment of the Supreme

Court in S. Sundaram Pillai vs. V.R. Pattabiraman, 1985(1) SCC


591. The Supreme Court referred to an earlier judgment of the

Supreme Court in 
Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P.
, (1973) 1

SCC 216 where it was held:-


             "On the basis of the language of the Explanation this
             Court held that it did not widen the scope of clause (c).
             But from what has been said in the case, it is clear that
             if on a true reading of an Explanation it appears that it
             has widened the scope of the main section, effect be given
             to legislative intent notwithstanding the fact that the
             Legislature named that provision as an Explanation."



The Supreme Court, therefore, recognized that an explanation

can widen the scope of the main section and in that event

effect must be given to the legislative intent, even though

the provision is termed as explanation. This judgment was

cited by Mr. Goyal, but it does not support his submissions in

respect of the ambit of an explanation introduced by an

amendment.



 
The judgment of the Supreme Court in 
Sulochana Amma

vs. Narayanan Nair
, 1994(2) SCC 14, cited by Mr. Goyal, also

supports the view taken by us and not his submissions in respect

of an explanation. In paragraph 8, the Supreme Court held:-


             "8. It is settled law that explanation to a section is not
             a substantive provision by itself. It is entitled to
             explain the meaning of the words contained in the section
             or clarify certain ambiguities or clear them up. It
             becomes a part and parcel of the enactment. Its meaning
             must depend upon its terms. Sometimes it would be added to
             include something within it or to exclude from the ambit
             of the main provision or some condition or words occurring
             in it. Therefore, the explanation normally should be so

          read as to harmonise with and to clear up any ambiguity in
          the same section."                    (emphasis supplied)


32.       
In 
Union of India and others vs. Martin Lottery

Agencies Limited
, (2009) 12 Supreme Court Cases 209, the

Supreme   Court       expressly held, in paragraph-50, that a

substantive law may be introduced by an explanation and, in

that   event,    it     would    not       have   retrospective        effect.




Paragraphs-34, 50 and 52 read as under:-

          "34. No doubt, the Explanation begins with the words
          "for removal of doubts". Does it mean that it is
          conclusive in nature? In law, it is not. It is not a
          case where by reason of a judgment of a court, the law
          was found to be vague or ambiguous. There is also
          nothing to show that it was found to be vague or
          ambiguous by the executive. In fact, the Board circular
          shows that invocation of sub-clause (ii) had never been
          in contemplation of the taxing authorities.

          .....                   .....                 .....           .....



          50. It is, therefore, evident that by reason of an
          explanation, a substantive law may also be introduced.
          If a substantive law is introduced, it will have no
          retrospective effect. The notice issued to the assessee
          by the appellant has, thus, rightly been held to be
          liable to be set aside.

          .....                   .....                 .....           .....



          52. As stated hereinbefore, for the aforementioned
          purpose, the expressions like "for the removal of
          doubts" are not conclusive. The said expressions appear
          to have been used under assumption that rganizing games
          of chance would be rendition of service. We are herein
          not concerned as to whether it was constitutionally
          permissible for Parliament to do so as we are not called
          upon to determine the said question but for our purpose,
          it would be suffice to hold that the Explanation is not
          clarificatory or declaratory in nature."



33.       It is clear beyond doubt, therefore, that an

explanation     introduced      by    an    amendment       is   not    always

retrospective. It may be prospective or retrospective. If it

is merely clarificatory of the original enactment or for the

removal of doubts as to any misunderstanding of the original

enactment, it would be retrospective. Further, as observed in

the last sentence in paragraph-33, if by reason of an

explanation, the taxing net has been widened, it cannot be

held   to   be   retrospective       in   operation.       In   our   view,

conversely, if by reason of an explanation, the original

provision is curtailed, it cannot be held to be retrospective

in operation. This would be so especially where substantive

rights of a party are dealt with.



34.         The Explanation introduced to Rule 3(iii) of the

said 1999 rules by the amendment was not necessitated on

account of any confusion or doubt about the ambit of the main

section. The judgment of the Division Bench did not notice any

ambiguity in the provisions of the main section. The Division

Bench merely opined that the question of eligibility of firms,

such as, the petitioners therein required a re-determination

by the rule making authority, namely, the State Government. In

fact, the opening part of the sentence which expresses this

view stated that in the absence of an express exclusion clause

in the rules for not taking into account the business

undertaken by a licenced firm in a sub-yard under the same

licence, which is granted for the old de-notified grain

market, the question of eligibility required re-determination.

This would indicate that the Division Bench was of the view

that in the absence of an express exclusion, the business

undertaken in the sub-yard cannot be excluded. In any event,

the Division Bench required the State Government to re-

determine the issue and not to clarify the provision.

35.          We held earlier that the main provision read by

itself did not exclude the business undertaken by a licenced

firm in a sub-yard, etc. The explanation, however, in terms

excludes the same while determining the eligibility of an

applicant to be allotted premises in the new grain market.

This was a substantive enactment contrary to the original

provision.        The      explanation         is        not    expressly     made

retrospective. There is nothing in its plain language that

makes it retrospective. Nor do we find any reason to hold that

it is retrospective by necessary intendment. Our attention has

not been invited to any material in this regard on behalf of

the respondents.



36.          In      the    circumstances,          it     is   held   that    the

explanation to Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules is

prospective and not retrospective. The petitioner is entitled

to have its rights determined in accordance with Rule 3(iii)

as it stood prior to the amendment, to wit, without reference

to the Explanation. The impugned orders are, therefore,

quashed and set aside. The respondents shall determine the

petitioner's eligibility accordingly by 31.08.2016.


             The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.

directing the respondents to allot in his favour a shop in the

New Grain Market. The petitioner claims to be entitled to a

plot/shop in the New Grain Market on the basis of his having

been a licensee in the old grain market.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_4, Content: 3.        The case in brief is this. The petitioner was a

licensee in the old grain market, which was de-notified. He

also carried on his business from a notified sub-yard. Upon

de-notification of the principal market yard, the petitioner

claims to be entitled, under a policy of the State of Punjab,

to be allotted premises in the New Grain Market. One of the

conditions of eligibility for allotment of premises in the New

Grain Market was that the licensee should have transacted

business of sale and purchase of agricultural produce for an

amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per annum during the last three

years. The petitioner would be eligible only if his business

in the de-notified principal market yard is clubbed with the

business transacted at the notified sub-yard. The respondents,

however, contend that such clubbing is not permissible while

determining the volume of business transacted by the licensee.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_5, Content: 4.        The first question, therefore, is whether the main

part of Rule-3 of the 1999 rules permitted clubbing. We have

come to the conclusion that Rule-3 permitted such clubbing.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_6, Content: By an amendment, an explanation was inserted which

did not permit clubbing. The second question, therefore, is

whether the explanation is retrospective or only prospective.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_7, Content: We have come to the conclusion that the explanation is

prospective for it affects the substantive rights of parties.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_8, Content: 5.        A licence dated 09.12.2002 was issued in favour of

the petitioner which was valid till 31.03.2005. It was renewed

lastly up to 31.03.2011. The licence was issued in respect of

several trades including as a merchant, Kacha Arhtia, Arhtia,

godown keeper, processor and for sale and purchase. The

licence stipulated Shop No.1723, Grain Market, Gidderbaha, as

the place of trade.

Marketing Board (Punjab Mandi Board) invited applications from

licensees of the Old Grain Market for allotment of plot/shop

sites in the New Grain Market in accordance with the

provisions of the said 1999 rules as amended up to 2008. The

petitioner applied for the same. Respondent No.2, by a letter

dated 23.05.2011, stated that the petitioner did not fulfil

several conditions. The petitioner was afforded an opportunity

of replying to this notice which he did by his letter dated

04.06.2011.

declared ineligible for the allotment of a plot on the ground

that the petitioner had not carried on the business of Kacha

Arhtia at the Old Grain Market from 10.01.2005 to 09.01.2008

and that the petitioner's claim of having transacted business

of Rs.5 lacs per year during the previous three years at the

application was, therefore, rejected on the ground that the

petitioner did not fulfil the criteria stipulated in Rule

disposed of by an order of the appellate authority dated

24.07.2012. The matter was remanded to the Estate Officer with

a direction to pass a speaking order afresh. The order also

stated that the appeal was disposed of in terms of an order

dated 24.07.2012 passed in another appeal in the case of M/s

Kisan Pesticides, Gidderbaha, stating that the case was

identical to the present case.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_17, Content: 10.       The order in M/s Kisan Pesticide's appeal has been

furnished. It appears that in that case the allegations were

made that through collusion the figures of the extent of

business were manipulated in connivance with certain officers.

There was a direction, therefore, for a proper investigation

to be carried out.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_18, Content: In the present writ petition, the respondents have

not contended that the figures have been manipulated. It has

only been contended that the business carried on in the sub-

market yard, etc. cannot be clubbed with the business carried

out in the principal market.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_19, Content: 11.         Upon remand, the Estate Officer, respondent No.3

once again rejected the petitioner's application on the ground

that the petitioner had not fulfilled the condition of having

business transactions of Rs.5 lacs per annum from 10.01.2005

to    09.01.2008.    It   was    observed      that    a    Committee    was

constituted to examine the facts of the cases remanded by the

appellate authority and that the report of the Committee in

the petitioner's case tallied with the record of the Market

Committee. It was also observed that the petitioner's business

transactions during the relevant period were of the Purchase

Centre of Lalbai of the Market Committee and not of the

Principal   Market     Yard     of    the   Committee       and   that   the

transactions at the two locations could not be clubbed in

order to ascertain whether the petitioner fulfilled the

eligibility criteria under Rule 3 of the 1999 rules. The

petitioner's application was accordingly rejected.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_20, Content: 12.         The applications of the other applicants, who were

also licensees in the old market, seeking similar benefits

under the same rules, were rejected. They challenged this

rejection by filing CWP No.20236 of 2011 titled as M/sParkash

Punjab and others, which were disposed of by an order and

that fell for consideration was whether the value of the

business carried on by the petitioners therein in the Sub-

allotment of plots at a concessional rate in the new market.

The petitioners therein contended that a sub-yard is an

integral part of the principal market and both the businesses

are liable to be clubbed together.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_22, Content: The respondents, on the other hand, denied this

contention and submitted that proof of requisite business is

to be determined on the basis of returns in Form-M, J-Form, I

and H-Register which are issued separately for the principal

market and sub-market yard. The Division Bench noted that as

per Rule 17(5) of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Market

(General) Rules, 1962 (for short, "the 1962 rules"), a

separate licence was required for establishing and continuing

the business at more than one place. It necessarily meant that

a separate licence was required for a sub-yard. It was further

noted that Rule 17(5) was omitted by a notification dated

30.03.1993 by the Punjab Government. After the notification,

the licence used for the principal market yard is valid to

carry on business in a sub-yard also. The Division Bench

disposed of the writ petition in the following terms:-
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_23, Content: 13.        Subsequently, the Government of Punjab issued a

notification dated 17.01.2014 in exercise of powers under

Section 43 read withSection 18of the Punjab Agricultural

Produce Markets Act, 1961 ((hereinafter to be referred to as

"the 1961 Act"), whereby the Governor of Punjab made rules

further   to    amend    the    1999       rules   by   the   Punjab   State

Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale and Transfer of Plots)

effect i.e. 17.01.2014. In Rule 3(iii), after the proviso, the

following explanation was inserted.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_24, Content: 14.        If the explanation is applicable, the petitioner

would not be eligible to be allotted a plot in the New Grain

Market. Two questions, therefore, arise. The first is, whether

Rule 3(iii), as it stood prior to its amendment by the

insertion of the Explanation, permitted the clubbing of the

business at a notified sub-yard, etc. and the business carried

on in the de-notified old market yard. If the answer to this

question is in the negative, the petition is liable to be

ineligible to be allotted a plot under the said 1999 rules.

If, however, the question is answered in the affirmative, the

next     question    would      be    whether        the    explanation        has

retrospective effect? If the explanation has retrospective

effect, the petitioner would certainly be ineligible. If not,

the petitioner would be eligible.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_26, Content: 15.         The     petitioner       must,       therefore,         succeed     in

establishing that Rule 3(iii) prior to the amendment permitted

the transactions at notified sub-yards etc. to be clubbed with

the transactions at the de-notified old market yard and that

the Explanation has only prospective and not retrospective

effect.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_27, Content: 
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_28, Content: 16.         The first question, therefore, is whether Rule

3(iii)    prior     to    its   amendment        permitted    the     licensees

transactions in a notified sub-yard or a purchase centre or

any additional yard to be clubbed with the transactions in a

de-notified old market yard for the purpose of computing the

volume of business referred to in Rule 3(iii).

Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_32, Content: 18.       We referred earlier to Rule 17(5) of the 1962 rules

and that, with effect from 30.03.1999, the requirement of a

separate licence to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. was

done away with. The first requirement under Rule 3(iii) of the

1999 rules, to be eligible for allotment of a plot in the new

market, is that a licensee had been granted a licence in the

old de-notified market. That the petitioner had. With effect

from 30.03.1999, it was not necessary for a person to obtain a

separate licence for operating from a notified sub-market

yard, etc. A licence in respect of the principal market yard

entitled a person to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. as

well.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_33, Content: 19.       The proviso to Rule 3(iii) stipulates that only

those licensees shall be eligible for allotment who had

transacted business for an amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per

annum during the last three years. It did not stipulate the

location from which such business had been transacted. The

business transacted from an authorised, to wit a notified sub-

market yard, etc., would fall within the ambit of the proviso

licensees shall be eligible for allotment of plots, who have

transacted the business of sale and purchase of agricultural

produce ...... .... ." The purpose of Rule 3 was to re-locate and

accommodate the licensees of the old de-notified grain market

in the new grain market on account of the old grain market

being de-notified. The sub-yards, etc. have not been de-

notified. The petitioner would, therefore, be entitled to

continue to operate from the notified sub-yards. They would,

however, cease operating from the de-notified principal market

yard in any event upon being allotted premises in the new

market yard.

3(iii) by the insertion of the Explanation thereto, in

determining the volume of an applicant's business, the value

of the transactions at a notified sub-yard or a purchase

centre   or     any     additional         yard    could   be    clubbed    with

transactions in the old market yard from where the applicant

operated under a valid licence prior to its de-notification.

Explanation is retrospective or only prospective.

Further, if the enactment is capable of either interpretation,

it ought to be construed as being prospective and not

note the judgment of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme

Court inShyam Sunder and another vs. Ram Kumar and another,

(2001)8 SCC 24.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_39, Content: 23.        We do not find the explanation to be retrospective.

It is certainly not made retrospective expressly. The plain

language does not suggest that it is retrospective. Nor do we

find it to be retrospective by necessary intendment. The

language of the explanation does not indicate it to be

clarificatory     of   the   Rule     as   it   stood.     Nor   does    the

explanation remove the basis for the interpretation of the

section.

the Supreme       Court     held that retrospectivity is to be

attributed in such cases "generally". We do not consider the

Supreme Court as having held that an explanation is always

clarificatory, curative or merely declaratory of the previous

law and, therefore, retrospective operation must always be

given to an explanation introduced to legislation by an

amendment.

           Explanation in 1983 effected a change in the scope of

           from 1979, "income payable for service rendered in

retrospective effect. It also militates against his submission

that an explanation introduced by an amendment always and of

necessity only explains or clarifies what the main section

always meant.

the last sentence in paragraph-33, if by reason of an

explanation, the taxing net has been widened, it cannot be

held   to   be   retrospective       in   operation.       In   our   view,

conversely, if by reason of an explanation, the original

provision is curtailed, it cannot be held to be retrospective

in operation. This would be so especially where substantive

rights of a party are dealt with.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_63, Content: 34.         The Explanation introduced to Rule 3(iii) of the

said 1999 rules by the amendment was not necessitated on

account of any confusion or doubt about the ambit of the main

section. The judgment of the Division Bench did not notice any

ambiguity in the provisions of the main section. The Division

Bench merely opined that the question of eligibility of firms,

such as, the petitioners therein required a re-determination

by the rule making authority, namely, the State Government. In

fact, the opening part of the sentence which expresses this

view stated that in the absence of an express exclusion clause

in the rules for not taking into account the business

undertaken by a licenced firm in a sub-yard under the same

licence, which is granted for the old de-notified grain

market, the question of eligibility required re-determination.

This would indicate that the Division Bench was of the view

that in the absence of an express exclusion, the business

undertaken in the sub-yard cannot be excluded. In any event,

the Division Bench required the State Government to re-

determine the issue and not to clarify the provision.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_64, Content: 35.          We held earlier that the main provision read by

itself did not exclude the business undertaken by a licenced

firm in a sub-yard, etc. The explanation, however, in terms

excludes the same while determining the eligibility of an

applicant to be allotted premises in the new grain market.

This was a substantive enactment contrary to the original

provision.        The      explanation         is        not    expressly     made

retrospective. There is nothing in its plain language that

makes it retrospective. Nor do we find any reason to hold that

it is retrospective by necessary intendment. Our attention has

not been invited to any material in this regard on behalf of

the respondents.
Tag: p, Class: , ID: p_65, Content: 36.          In      the    circumstances,          it     is   held   that    the

explanation to Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules is

prospective and not retrospective. The petitioner is entitled

to have its rights determined in accordance with Rule 3(iii)

as it stood prior to the amendment, to wit, without reference

to the Explanation. The impugned orders are, therefore,

quashed and set aside. The respondents shall determine the

petitioner's eligibility accordingly by 31.08.2016.

and style of the petitioner and as the sole proprietor

thereof.2.         The petitioner has sought a writ of certiorari to

quash an order dated 28.04.2014 passed by respondent No.1, an

order dated 30.04.2013 and an order dated 18.10.2011 passed by

respondent No.3 whereby its claim for the allotment of a

plot/shop site in the New Grain Market on a preferential basis

has been rejected. The petitioner has also sought a writ of

certiorari to quash a notification dated 17.01.2014 by which

an explanation to Rule 3(iii) of the Punjab State Agricultural

Marketing Board (Sale and Transfer of Plots) Rules, 1999

directing the respondents to allot in his favour a shop in the

New Grain Market. The petitioner claims to be entitled to a

plot/shop in the New Grain Market on the basis of his having

been a licensee in the old grain market.3.        The case in brief is this. The petitioner was a

licensee in the old grain market, which was de-notified. He

also carried on his business from a notified sub-yard. Upon

de-notification of the principal market yard, the petitioner

claims to be entitled, under a policy of the State of Punjab,

to be allotted premises in the New Grain Market. One of the

conditions of eligibility for allotment of premises in the New

Grain Market was that the licensee should have transacted

business of sale and purchase of agricultural produce for an

amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per annum during the last three

years. The petitioner would be eligible only if his business

in the de-notified principal market yard is clubbed with the

business transacted at the notified sub-yard. The respondents,

however, contend that such clubbing is not permissible while

determining the volume of business transacted by the licensee.4.        The first question, therefore, is whether the main

part of Rule-3 of the 1999 rules permitted clubbing. We have

come to the conclusion that Rule-3 permitted such clubbing.By an amendment, an explanation was inserted which

did not permit clubbing. The second question, therefore, is

whether the explanation is retrospective or only prospective.2 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                        - 3 -We have come to the conclusion that the explanation is

prospective for it affects the substantive rights of parties.5.        A licence dated 09.12.2002 was issued in favour of

the petitioner which was valid till 31.03.2005. It was renewed

lastly up to 31.03.2011. The licence was issued in respect of

several trades including as a merchant, Kacha Arhtia, Arhtia,

godown keeper, processor and for sale and purchase. The

licence stipulated Shop No.1723, Grain Market, Gidderbaha, as

the place of trade.6.        On       10.01.2008,        respondent       No.2-Punjab   State

Marketing Board (Punjab Mandi Board) invited applications from

licensees of the Old Grain Market for allotment of plot/shop

sites in the New Grain Market in accordance with the

provisions of the said 1999 rules as amended up to 2008. The

petitioner applied for the same. Respondent No.2, by a letter

dated 23.05.2011, stated that the petitioner did not fulfil

several conditions. The petitioner was afforded an opportunity

of replying to this notice which he did by his letter dated

04.06.2011.7.        By an order dated 18.10.2011, passed by respondent

No.3-Estate Officer, Punjab Mandi Board, the petitioner was

declared ineligible for the allotment of a plot on the ground

that the petitioner had not carried on the business of Kacha

Arhtia at the Old Grain Market from 10.01.2005 to 09.01.2008

and that the petitioner's claim of having transacted business

of Rs.5 lacs per year during the previous three years at the

Committee. It was held, therefore, that the petitioner did not

fulfil the condition of having transacted business of at least

Rs.5 lacs per annum for the period of three years preceding

the date of the demand of applications i.e. 10.01.2008. The

application was, therefore, rejected on the ground that the

petitioner did not fulfil the criteria stipulated in Rule

3(iii) of the said 1999 rules.8.           Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules, as it stood

prior to the amendment which introduced the explanation, read

as under:-"3.Sale of plots.-[Sections 43 and 18 of Punjab Act 23

                 provisions of Form 'H' and Form 'J' as specified
                 in the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets
                 (General) Rules, 1962 read with the provisions of
                 Form "F', as specified in the bye-laws of the
                 Market Committee for the aforesaid period of three
                 years.   The period of three years referred to
                 above shall be counted with effect from the date
                 of notice inviting applications for allotment.

                Provided that only those licensees shall be
          eligible for allotment of plots, who have transacted the
          business of sale and purchase of agricultural produce
          for an amount, not less than five lacs rupees per annum
          during the last three years."9.        The petitioner's appeal against the order was

disposed of by an order of the appellate authority dated

24.07.2012. The matter was remanded to the Estate Officer with

a direction to pass a speaking order afresh. The order also

stated that the appeal was disposed of in terms of an order

dated 24.07.2012 passed in another appeal in the case of M/s

Kisan Pesticides, Gidderbaha, stating that the case was

identical to the present case.10.       The order in M/s Kisan Pesticide's appeal has been

furnished. It appears that in that case the allegations were

made that through collusion the figures of the extent of

business were manipulated in connivance with certain officers.

There was a direction, therefore, for a proper investigation

to be carried out.In the present writ petition, the respondents have

not contended that the figures have been manipulated. It has

only been contended that the business carried on in the sub-

market yard, etc. cannot be clubbed with the business carried

out in the principal market.5 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                           - 6 -11.         Upon remand, the Estate Officer, respondent No.3

once again rejected the petitioner's application on the ground

that the petitioner had not fulfilled the condition of having

business transactions of Rs.5 lacs per annum from 10.01.2005

constituted to examine the facts of the cases remanded by the

appellate authority and that the report of the Committee in

the petitioner's case tallied with the record of the Market

Committee. It was also observed that the petitioner's business

transactions during the relevant period were of the Purchase

Centre of Lalbai of the Market Committee and not of the

Principal   Market     Yard     of    the   Committee       and   that   the

transactions at the two locations could not be clubbed in

order to ascertain whether the petitioner fulfilled the

eligibility criteria under Rule 3 of the 1999 rules. The

petitioner's application was accordingly rejected.12.         The applications of the other applicants, who were

also licensees in the old market, seeking similar benefits

under the same rules, were rejected. They challenged this

rejection by filing CWP No.20236 of 2011 titled as M/sParkash

Chand Mehar Chand vs. State of Punjab and othersand CWP

No.6127 of 2011 titled: M/sBrar Trading Company vs. State of

Punjab and others, which were disposed of by an order and

judgment of the Division Bench dated 14.02.2013. The question

that fell for consideration was whether the value of the

business carried on by the petitioners therein in the Sub-

Market Yard can be added to the total value of the business

allotment of plots at a concessional rate in the new market.

The petitioners therein contended that a sub-yard is an

integral part of the principal market and both the businesses

are liable to be clubbed together.The respondents, on the other hand, denied this

contention and submitted that proof of requisite business is

to be determined on the basis of returns in Form-M, J-Form, I

and H-Register which are issued separately for the principal

market and sub-market yard. The Division Bench noted that as

per Rule 17(5) of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Market

(General) Rules, 1962 (for short, "the 1962 rules"), a

separate licence was required for establishing and continuing

the business at more than one place. It necessarily meant that

a separate licence was required for a sub-yard. It was further

noted that Rule 17(5) was omitted by a notification dated

30.03.1993 by the Punjab Government. After the notification,

the licence used for the principal market yard is valid to

carry on business in a sub-yard also. The Division Bench

disposed of the writ petition in the following terms:-"In the absence of an express exclusion clause in the
          Rules for not taking into account the business
          undertaken by a licenced firm in a sub-yard under the
          same licence which is granted for the old denotified
          grain market, we are of the considered view that the
          question of eligibility of firms like the petitioner
          requires re-determination by the rule making Authority,
          namely, the State Government in active consultation with
          the Punjab Mandi Board. Consequently and for the afore-
          stated purpose, these writ petitions are allowed to the
          extent that the order dated 15.2.2010 (Annexure P-9)
          passed by the State Government in exercise of its
          revisional powers under the Act is set aside and the
          matter is remitted to the Principal Secretary to

           a uniform policy decision in prior consultation with the
           Punjab Mandi Board and then determine the eligibility of
           the petitioner or other similarly placed firms. The
           needful shall be done as early as possible preferably
           within a period of four months from the date of receipt
           of certified copy of this order."13.        Subsequently, the Government of Punjab issued a

notification dated 17.01.2014 in exercise of powers under

Section 43 read withSection 18of the Punjab Agricultural

Produce Markets Act, 1961 ((hereinafter to be referred to as

"the 1961 Act"), whereby the Governor of Punjab made rules

further   to    amend    the    1999       rules   by   the   Punjab   State

Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale and Transfer of Plots)

(Amendment) Rules, 2014, which came into force with immediate

effect i.e. 17.01.2014. In Rule 3(iii), after the proviso, the

following explanation was inserted."Explanation:    The transactions made by a
           licensee in a notified sub-yard or a purchase
           centre or any additional yard, as the case may be,
           shall not be clubbed with any transaction in a de-
           notified old market yard, for the purpose of
           computing the above amount, to determine the
           eligibility for allotment of a plot under these
           rules."14.        If the explanation is applicable, the petitioner

would not be eligible to be allotted a plot in the New Grain

Market. Two questions, therefore, arise. The first is, whether

Rule 3(iii), as it stood prior to its amendment by the

insertion of the Explanation, permitted the clubbing of the

business at a notified sub-yard, etc. and the business carried

on in the de-notified old market yard. If the answer to this

question is in the negative, the petition is liable to be

ineligible to be allotted a plot under the said 1999 rules.

If, however, the question is answered in the affirmative, the

next     question    would      be    whether        the    explanation        has

retrospective effect? If the explanation has retrospective

effect, the petitioner would certainly be ineligible. If not,

the petitioner would be eligible.15.         The     petitioner       must,       therefore,         succeed     in

establishing that Rule 3(iii) prior to the amendment permitted

the transactions at notified sub-yards etc. to be clubbed with

the transactions at the de-notified old market yard and that

the Explanation has only prospective and not retrospective

effect.16.         The first question, therefore, is whether Rule

3(iii)    prior     to    its   amendment        permitted    the     licensees

transactions in a notified sub-yard or a purchase centre or

any additional yard to be clubbed with the transactions in a

de-notified old market yard for the purpose of computing the

volume of business referred to in Rule 3(iii).17.Sections 2(n)and7of the 1961 Act read as under:-"2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context
            otherwise requires,-(a) to (m) .....                 .....                .....             .....

          market area, there shall be one principal market yard, one or
          more sub-market yards and one or more private market yards as
          may be necessary.(2) The State Government may, by notification, declare
          any enclosure, building or locality in any notified market
          area to be principal market yard for the area and other
          enclosures, buildings or localities to be one or more sub-market yards or one or more private market yards for the
          area.(3) Every person or company or co-operative society, as
          the case may be, desiring to obtain a licence for private
          market yard, shall apply to such authority, in such manner
          and with such fee, as may be prescribed."18.       We referred earlier to Rule 17(5) of the 1962 rules

and that, with effect from 30.03.1999, the requirement of a

separate licence to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. was

done away with. The first requirement under Rule 3(iii) of the

1999 rules, to be eligible for allotment of a plot in the new

market, is that a licensee had been granted a licence in the

old de-notified market. That the petitioner had. With effect

from 30.03.1999, it was not necessary for a person to obtain a

separate licence for operating from a notified sub-market

yard, etc. A licence in respect of the principal market yard

entitled a person to operate from a sub-market yard, etc. as

well.19.       The proviso to Rule 3(iii) stipulates that only

those licensees shall be eligible for allotment who had

transacted business for an amount not less than Rs.5 lacs per

annum during the last three years. It did not stipulate the

location from which such business had been transacted. The

business transacted from an authorised, to wit a notified sub-

market yard, etc., would fall within the ambit of the proviso

proviso to be re-written by adding to it the words "from the

principal     market"       after    the       words   "Provided    only   those

licensees shall be eligible for allotment of plots, who have

transacted the business of sale and purchase of agricultural

produce ...... .... ." The purpose of Rule 3 was to re-locate and

accommodate the licensees of the old de-notified grain market

in the new grain market on account of the old grain market

being de-notified. The sub-yards, etc. have not been de-

notified. The petitioner would, therefore, be entitled to

continue to operate from the notified sub-yards. They would,

however, cease operating from the de-notified principal market

yard in any event upon being allotted premises in the new

market yard.20.           In the circumstances, prior to the amendment of Rule

3(iii) by the insertion of the Explanation thereto, in

determining the volume of an applicant's business, the value

of the transactions at a notified sub-yard or a purchase

centre   or     any     additional         yard    could   be    clubbed    with

transactions in the old market yard from where the applicant

operated under a valid licence prior to its de-notification.21.           This brings us to the question as to whether the

Explanation is retrospective or only prospective.22.           There    is     a     presumption        against     retrospective

operation of a statute. A statute which affects substantive

rights is presumed to be prospective in operation unless it is




                                    11 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                          - 12 -made retrospective expressly or by necessary intendment.

Further, if the enactment is capable of either interpretation,

it ought to be construed as being prospective and not

retrospective. It is sufficient, in this regard, to merely

note the judgment of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme

Court inShyam Sunder and another vs. Ram Kumar and another,

(2001)8 SCC 24.23.        We do not find the explanation to be retrospective.

It is certainly not made retrospective expressly. The plain

language does not suggest that it is retrospective. Nor do we

find it to be retrospective by necessary intendment. The

language of the explanation does not indicate it to be

clarificatory     of   the   Rule     as   it   stood.     Nor   does    the

explanation remove the basis for the interpretation of the

section.24.        Mr. Goyal relied upon the following observations of
the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Shyam Sunder's
case (supra) to contend that the explanation introduced by an
amendment must always and of necessity be considered to have
retrospective effect:-"42. G.P.     Singh   on    Principles    of  Statutory
           Interpretation quoting Craies stated thus:"For modern purposes a declaratory Act may be
                 defined as an Act to remove doubts existing as to
                 the common law, or the meaning or effect of any
                 statute. Such Acts are usually held to be
                 retrospective. The usual reason for passing a
                 declaratory Act is to set aside what Parliament
                 deems to have been a judicial error, whether in
                 the statement of the common law or in the
                 interpretation of statutes. Usually, if not
                 invariably, such an Act contains a preamble, and
                 also the word "declared" as well as the word
                 "enacted".' But the use of the words 'it is

                   declaratory for these words may, at times, be used
                   to introduce new rules of law and the Act in the
                   latter case will only be amending the law and will
                   not necessarily be retrospective. In determining,
                   therefore, the nature of the Act, regard must be
                   had to the substance rather than to the form.If a new Act is 'to explain' an earlier Act, it would be
             without object unless construed retrospective. An
             explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious
             omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the
             previous Act. It is well settled that if a statute is
             curative or merely declaratory of the previous law
             retrospective operation is generally intended."43.InKeshavlal Jethalal Shah v. Mohanlal Bhagwandas,
             1969 R.C.R. (Rent) 123: 1968(3) SCR 623, this Court
             while interpreting Section 29(2) of the amending Act,
             held thus:"An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply
                   an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to
                   the meaning of the previous Act. Section 29(2)
                   before it was enacted was precise in its
                   implication as well as in its expression; the
                   meaning of the words used was not in doubt, and
                   there was no omission in its phraseology which was
                   required to be supplied by the amendment."25.          It is important to note that in both the paragraphs,

the Supreme       Court     held that retrospectivity is to be

attributed in such cases "generally". We do not consider the

Supreme Court as having held that an explanation is always

clarificatory, curative or merely declaratory of the previous

law and, therefore, retrospective operation must always be

given to an explanation introduced to legislation by an

amendment.26.          Mr. Goyal's reliance upon the judgment of three

learned Judges of the Supreme Court in the case ofZile Singh

vs. State of Haryana, 2004(8) SCC 1, does not support his

under:-"13. It is a cardinal principle of construction
                 that every statute is prima facie prospective
                 unless it is expressly or by necessary implication
                 made to have a retrospective operation. But the
                 rule in general is applicable where the object of
                 the statute is to affect vested rights or to
                 impose new burdens or to impair existing
                 obligations. Unless there are words in the statute
                 sufficient to show the intention of the
                 legislature to affect existing rights, it is
                 deemed to be prospective only -- "nova constitutio
                 futuris formam imponere debet non praeteritis" -- a
                 new law ought to regulate what is to follow, not
                 the    past.   (See   Principles    of   Statutory
                 Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn.,
                 2004 at p. 438.) It is not necessary that an
                 express provision be made to make a statute
                 retrospective   and    the   presumption   against
                 retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary
                 implication especially in a case where the new law
                 is made to cure an acknowledged evil for the
                 benefit of the community as a whole (ibid., p.440)."There is no doubt that the presumption against

retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary implication. The

question is whether the explanation in the case before us can

be said to be retrospective by necessary implication.27.       The judgments, we will now refer to, were not cited

at the bar. We, therefore, invited the attention of the

Counsel to these judgments and invited their submissions in

respect thereof.28.InSedco Forex International Drill Inc. and others

head "salary", if it is earned in India, is included in such

income. To overcome a decision of the Gujarat High Court inCIT vs. S.G. Pgnatale, (1980) 124 ITR 391 (Guj),section

9(1)(ii)was amended by inserting the following explanation:-"Explanation.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
          declared that income of the nature referred to in this
          clause payable for service rendered in India shall be
          regarded as income earned in India."It is important to note that the explanation opened

with the words "For the removal of doubts .... ...... ......". In the

case before us, these words are absent. Despite the same, the

Supreme Court held that the explanation could not apply to

the previous assessment years. It was held as follows:-"10. In our view the 1999 Explanation could not
          apply to assessment years for the simple reason that it
          had not come into effect then. Prior to introducing the
          1999 Explanation, the decision inCIT v. S.G. Pgnatale[(1980) 124 ITR 391 (Guj)] was followed in 1989 by a
          Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court inCIT v.
          Goslino Mario[(2000) 241 ITR 314 (Gau)] . It found that
          the 1983 Explanation had been given effect from 1-4-1979
          whereas the year in questionin that casewas 1976-77
          and said: (ITR p. 318)

                 "[I]t is settled law that assessment has to be
                 made with reference to the law which is in
                 existence at the relevant time. The mere fact that
                 the assessments in question has (sic) somehow
                 remained pending on 1-4-1979, cannot be cogent
                 reason to make the Explanation applicable to the
                 cases of the present assessees. This fortuitous
                 circumstance cannot take away the vested rights of
                 the assessees at hand.".....          .....                 .....     .....18. There was and is no ambiguity in the main
          provision ofSection 9(1)(ii). It includes salaries in
          the total income of an assessee if the assessee has
          earned it in India. The word "earned" had been15 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                         - 16 -judicially defined in S.G. Pgnatale [(1980) 124 ITR 391
           (Guj)] by the High Court of Gujarat, in our view,
           correctly, to mean as income "arising or accruing in
           India". The amendment to the section by way of an
           Explanation in 1983 effected a change in the scope of
           that judicial definition so as to include with effect
           from 1979, "income payable for service rendered in
           India".19. When the Explanation seeks to give an
           artificial meaning to "earned in India" and brings about
           a change effectively in the existing law and in addition
           is stated to come into force with effect from a future
           date, there is no principle of interpretation which
           would justify reading the Explanation as operating
           retrospectively."                     (emphasis supplied)

           This judgment clearly militates against Mr. Goyal's

extreme   proposition       that     an     explanation      always   has   a

retrospective effect. It also militates against his submission

that an explanation introduced by an amendment always and of

necessity only explains or clarifies what the main section

always meant.29.InGovernment of Andhra Pradesh and another vs.

Corporation Bank, (2007) 9 Supreme Court Cases 55, the Supreme

Court held:-"12. In construing a statutory provision, the first and
           foremost rule of construction is the literal

           Development and Cane Marketing Union Ltd. v. Bank of
           Bihar[AIR 1967 SC 389] this Court was called upon to
           consider Explanation toSection 48(1)of the Bihar and
           Orissa Cooperative Societies Act, 1935. This Court
           observed that the Court should not go only by the label.
           The Court observed that an explanation must be read
           ordinarily to clear up any ambiguity in the main section
           and it cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the
           section. However, if on a true reading of an Explanation
           it appears to the Court in a given case that the effect
           of the Explanation is to widen the scope of the main



                                 16 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                     - 17 -section then effect must be given to the legislative
          intent. It was held that in all such cases the Court has
          to find out the true intention of the legislature.
          Therefore, there is no single yardstick to decide
          whether an Explanation is enacted to clarify the
          ambiguity or whether it is enacted to widen the scope of
          the main section. On the facts it was held that before
          the 1948Amendment to the Bihar and Orissa Cooperative
          Societies Act, 1935, there was an Explanation on the
          statute-book and the subsequent Explanation was only to
          clarify the earlier Explanation and, therefore, the
          Court held that the purpose of the subsequent
          Explanation was not to enlarge the scope ofSection
          48(1)(e)in theBihar and Orissa Cooperative Societies
          Act, 1935. In the present case prior to amending Act 27
          of 1996, there was no Explanation covering banks, LICs,
          etc. As stated above, Explanation IV was added for the
          first time by the said amending Act 27 of 1996. The
          definition of the word "dealer" thus stands expanded by
          the said amending Act 27 of 1996. In our view,
          therefore, Explanation IV was not to clear any doubt or
          ambiguity. It has been enacted in order to expand the
          definition of the word "dealer" inSection 2(1)(e)of
          the 1957 Act."                        (emphasis supplied)

          An explanation is not necessarily or always to clear

a doubt or ambiguity. It can alter the scope and ambit of the

main section substantially. When, therefore, by an amendment

an explanation is added it would be necessary to examine

whether it affects the main section.30.       In our view, if an explanation can expand a

definition, it can equally restrict it. In the case before us,

the explanation has restricted the eligibility criteria.

Further, if it can expand a definition, it can also expand any

other aspect of the definition. It would follow again that if

it can expand any other aspect of the enactment, it can

equally restrict it. This is what has been done by the

Explanation in Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules. The

explanation   has     restricted       the   eligibility    criteria   of

the new market.31.          Our view is supported by a judgment of the Supreme

Court in S. Sundaram Pillai vs. V.R. Pattabiraman, 1985(1) SCC591. The Supreme Court referred to an earlier judgment of the

Supreme Court inHiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1

SCC 216 where it was held:-"On the basis of the language of the Explanation this
             Court held that it did not widen the scope of clause (c).
             But from what has been said in the case, it is clear that
             if on a true reading of an Explanation it appears that it
             has widened the scope of the main section, effect be given
             to legislative intent notwithstanding the fact that the
             Legislature named that provision as an Explanation."The Supreme Court, therefore, recognized that an explanation

can widen the scope of the main section and in that event

effect must be given to the legislative intent, even though

the provision is termed as explanation. This judgment was

cited by Mr. Goyal, but it does not support his submissions in

respect of the ambit of an explanation introduced by an

amendment.The judgment of the Supreme Court inSulochana Amma

vs. Narayanan Nair, 1994(2) SCC 14, cited by Mr. Goyal, also

supports the view taken by us and not his submissions in respect

of an explanation. In paragraph 8, the Supreme Court held:-"8. It is settled law that explanation to a section is not
             a substantive provision by itself. It is entitled to
             explain the meaning of the words contained in the section
             or clarify certain ambiguities or clear them up. It
             becomes a part and parcel of the enactment. Its meaning
             must depend upon its terms. Sometimes it would be added to
             include something within it or to exclude from the ambit
             of the main provision or some condition or words occurring
             in it. Therefore, the explanation normally should be so

          the same section."                    (emphasis supplied)32.InUnion of India and others vs. Martin Lottery

Agencies Limited, (2009) 12 Supreme Court Cases 209, the

Supreme   Court       expressly held, in paragraph-50, that a

substantive law may be introduced by an explanation and, in

that   event,    it     would    not       have   retrospective        effect.Paragraphs-34, 50 and 52 read as under:-"34. No doubt, the Explanation begins with the words
          "for removal of doubts". Does it mean that it is
          conclusive in nature? In law, it is not. It is not a
          case where by reason of a judgment of a court, the law
          was found to be vague or ambiguous. There is also
          nothing to show that it was found to be vague or
          ambiguous by the executive. In fact, the Board circular
          shows that invocation of sub-clause (ii) had never been
          in contemplation of the taxing authorities......                   .....                 .....           .....50. It is, therefore, evident that by reason of an
          explanation, a substantive law may also be introduced.
          If a substantive law is introduced, it will have no
          retrospective effect. The notice issued to the assessee
          by the appellant has, thus, rightly been held to be
          liable to be set aside......                   .....                 .....           .....52. As stated hereinbefore, for the aforementioned
          purpose, the expressions like "for the removal of
          doubts" are not conclusive. The said expressions appear
          to have been used under assumption that rganizing games
          of chance would be rendition of service. We are herein
          not concerned as to whether it was constitutionally
          permissible for Parliament to do so as we are not called
          upon to determine the said question but for our purpose,
          it would be suffice to hold that the Explanation is not
          clarificatory or declaratory in nature."33.       It is clear beyond doubt, therefore, that an

explanation     introduced      by    an    amendment       is   not    always

retrospective. It may be prospective or retrospective. If it

is merely clarificatory of the original enactment or for the

removal of doubts as to any misunderstanding of the original

the last sentence in paragraph-33, if by reason of an

explanation, the taxing net has been widened, it cannot be

held   to   be   retrospective       in   operation.       In   our   view,

conversely, if by reason of an explanation, the original

provision is curtailed, it cannot be held to be retrospective

in operation. This would be so especially where substantive

rights of a party are dealt with.34.         The Explanation introduced to Rule 3(iii) of the

said 1999 rules by the amendment was not necessitated on

account of any confusion or doubt about the ambit of the main

section. The judgment of the Division Bench did not notice any

ambiguity in the provisions of the main section. The Division

Bench merely opined that the question of eligibility of firms,

such as, the petitioners therein required a re-determination

by the rule making authority, namely, the State Government. In

fact, the opening part of the sentence which expresses this

view stated that in the absence of an express exclusion clause

in the rules for not taking into account the business

undertaken by a licenced firm in a sub-yard under the same

licence, which is granted for the old de-notified grain

market, the question of eligibility required re-determination.

This would indicate that the Division Bench was of the view

that in the absence of an express exclusion, the business

undertaken in the sub-yard cannot be excluded. In any event,

the Division Bench required the State Government to re-

determine the issue and not to clarify the provision.20 of 22::: Downloaded on - 21-05-2016 00:16:08 :::CWP-15928-2014                                                                - 21 -35.          We held earlier that the main provision read by

itself did not exclude the business undertaken by a licenced

firm in a sub-yard, etc. The explanation, however, in terms

excludes the same while determining the eligibility of an

applicant to be allotted premises in the new grain market.

This was a substantive enactment contrary to the original

provision.        The      explanation         is        not    expressly     made

retrospective. There is nothing in its plain language that

makes it retrospective. Nor do we find any reason to hold that

it is retrospective by necessary intendment. Our attention has

not been invited to any material in this regard on behalf of

the respondents.36.          In      the    circumstances,          it     is   held   that    the

explanation to Rule 3(iii) of the said 1999 rules is

prospective and not retrospective. The petitioner is entitled

to have its rights determined in accordance with Rule 3(iii)

as it stood prior to the amendment, to wit, without reference

to the Explanation. The impugned orders are, therefore,

quashed and set aside. The respondents shall determine the

petitioner's eligibility accordingly by 31.08.2016.The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.(S.J. VAZIFDAR)
